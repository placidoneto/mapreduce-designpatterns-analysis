... In order to achieve this goal we formulated three research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\em RQ1: Which are the main map reduce design patterns used in data
analysis?} This question is devoted to measure the map reduce design patterns
used in big data analysis and to verify which of them are the most common.

\item {\em RQ2: What type of solutions have been proposed considering map
reduce design patterns?} This question will help us to identify how map reduce
design patterns are used in data analysis, and also
what type of solution have been proposed for each kind of pattern or
composition of patterns. It will let us identify how the patterns can be
composed to a better big data analysis result.

\item  {\em RQ3: Which type of relationship between patterns are proposed to
improve the results of big data analysis?} \ldots

\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Expressing the  query for generating a data collection}
%.........................................................
Considering the research questions, we defined a set of keywords to be used for
searching relevant works. Based on these keywords and their
correlated words the query used was:
