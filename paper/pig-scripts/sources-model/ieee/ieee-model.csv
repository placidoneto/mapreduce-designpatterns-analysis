The ability to store and process increasing amounts of data has transformed many research disciplines, like the life-sciences, which now rely on complex data processing and data analytics. Cloud environments are able to integrate and encapsulate possibly distributed resources and allow convenient and on-demand access to the corresponding services, tools, and complete work environments. The European research project EASI-CLOUDS (http://www. easi-clouds.eu) develops a platform for a convenient service delivery with special regard to service integration, monitoring, management, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation and with the option to federate cloud resources between multiple installations. In order to demonstrate the capabilities a use-case for a medical service cloud has been developed in close partnership with the ChariteÃÅ university hospital which has a high demand on computing resources for the research in MRI related diagnostics of brain diseases. This use-case serves as the basis for the development of clouds for medical research in particular.","","","","10.1109/IWSG.2014.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882066","FreeSurfer;IaaS;PaaS;SaaS;cloud;cloud service platform;medical imaging;portal","Biomedical imaging;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Monitoring;Portals;Pricing","cloud computing;medical image processing;medical information systems","EASI-CLOUDS Project;MRI related diagnostics;brain diseases;cloud environments;complex data processing;data analytics;medical research Cloud;service integration;service level agreement negotiation;service management;service monitoring","","","","","","19","","","20140825","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

This requires domain-specific knowledge to correctly reason about network behavior and properties, as the SDN is now tightly coupled to the larger system. Existing tools for SDN verification and analysis are insufficiently expressive to capture this composition of network and domain models. Unfortunately, it is exactly this kind of automated reasoning and verification that is necessary to develop robust SDN-enabled applications for real-world systems. In this paper, we present ongoing work on Verificare, a verification platform being built to enable formal verification of SDNs as components of a larger domain-specific system. SLA, safety, and security requirements can selected from a variety of formal libraries and automatically verified using a variety of off-the-shelf tools. This approach not only extends the flexibility of existing SDN verification systems, but can actually provide more fine-grained analysis of possible network states due to extra information supplied by the domain model.","","","","10.1109/IC2E.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903492","formal verification;software-defined networking","Libraries;Monitoring;Security;Semantics;Servers;Switches","contracts;distributed processing;formal verification;security of data","Hadoop system;SDN analysis;SDN verification;SDN-enabled applications;SLA;Verificare;application-layer systems;application-specific functionality;control semantics;formal verification;network behavior;network monitoring semantics;network property;safety requirement;security requirement;service level agreement;software defined networking;verification platform","","","","","","","","","20140922","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a different approach: sensor networks are modeled as providers that offer their resources to a Cloud application that runs independently from Cloud providers. Being offered as a Service, any user can negotiate with the provider his desired requirements in terms of operational parameters and non-functional features (i.e. security, dependability, etc). In particular, we propose a SLA-based approach for the specification and management of usage term guarantees related to the access and configuration of private sensor networks. To this end, a Cloud Sensing Brokering Platform is designed to illustrate the innovative way to integrate Cloud and Sensor Networks.","","","","10.1109/CloudCom.2013.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753797","Cloud Computing;SLA;Sensor Network;mOSAIC","Cloud computing;Monitoring;Registers;Sensors;Servers;Standards;Wireless sensor networks","cloud computing;contracts;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks","IaaS;SLA-based approach;cloud computing;cloud providers;cloud sensing brokering platform;nonfunctional features;operational parameters;private sensor network access;private sensor network configuration;resource virtualization;sensing infrastructure integration;sensor data-as-a-service;sensor network as-a-service management;sensor network modeling","","","","0","","18","","","20140306","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, IDaaS introduces the same kind of problems regarding privacy and data confidentiality as other cloud services; on top of that, the nature of the outsourced information (users' identity) is critical. Traditionally, cloud services (including IDaaS) rely only on SLAs and security policies to protect the data, but these measures have proven insufficient in some cases; recent research has employed advanced cryptographic mechanisms as an additional safeguard. Apart from this, there are several identity management schemes that could be used for realizing IDaaS systems in the cloud; among them, OpenID has gained crescent popularity because of its open and decentralized nature, which makes it a prime candidate for this task. In this paper we demonstrate how a privacy-preserving IDaaS system can be implemented using OpenID Attribute Exchange and a proxy re-encryption scheme. Our prototype enables an identity provider to serve attributes to other parties without being able to read their values. This proposal constitutes a novel contribution to both privacy and identity management fields. Finally, we discuss the performance and economical viability of our proposal.","","978-1-4673-4511-8","978-1-4673-4509-5","10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6427551","OpenID;cloud computing;cryptography;encryption;identity management;privacy;proxy reencryption","Authentication;Cloud computing;Encryption;Privacy;Proposals;Public key","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy","IDaaS;OpenID attribute exchange;OpenID integration;SLA;cloud computing;cloud service;cloud-based identity service;cryptographic mechanism;data confidentiality;data privacy enhancement;data protection;decentralized nature;identity management as a service;identity provider;outsourced information;proxy re-encryption scheme;security policy","","","","1","","23","","","20130204","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing resource management systems in data centers are yet to support Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation, and thus need to be enhanced to realize cloud computing and utility computing. In addition, no work has been done to collectively incorporate customer-driven service management, computational risk management, and autonomic resource management into a market-based resource management system to target the rapidly changing enterprise requirements of Cloud computing. This paper presents vision, challenges, and architectural elements of SLA-oriented resource management.

System dynamics make it difficult to implement optimization in both aspects on shared infrastructures. A majority of existing works either focused on one aspect or applied models that are trained offline for application-specific workload. In addition, virtualization is being widely used in large-scale data centers to attain basic benefits like fault and performance isolation, and to improve system manageability. A key challenge that comes with virtualization is to dynamically provisioning resources for virtual machines and optimize their capacity for meeting service level objectives at the lowest possible cost. In this paper, we present a hierarchical management framework to assure application-level performance while minimizing power consumption for virtualized data centers. A novelty of the management framework is to combine control theory with linear programming technique. Empirical results show that the proposed framework brings substantial energy saving, while ensuring application performance. Especially, the integration of the performance controller and the energy optimizer results in an energy saving of 43% on our hardware testbed.","","978-1-4577-1006-3","978-0-7695-4466-3","10.1109/GreenCom.2011.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061322","data center;energy optimizer;performance controller;virtualization","Central Processing Unit;Energy consumption;Power demand;Resource management;Servers;Time factors;Virtual machining","computer centres;linear programming;power aware computing;virtual machines","SLA;data center management;linear programming technique;performance management framework;power consumption;power management framework;service level agreement;virtual machines;virtualized data centers;virtualized server clusters","","","","0","","19","","","20111027","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this environment, data producers and capability providers supply data and capabilities to the enterprise through a service paradigm. This vision embraces a common infrastructure, interoperability of capabilities, services that represent reusable building blocks, and coordinated management providing Situational Awareness (SA) of the environment. As a result of this vision, the DoD is developing and acquiring Enterprise Services (ES), resulting in a situation where services are supplied to end-users by two types of providers: Managed Service Providers (MSPs) and Government Application Service Providers (GASPs). Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) are an essential element of the service paradigm in this context. Consequently, it is necessary that recommendations for guidance on sufficient and effective SLAs be developed to help ensure the success of programs developing or acquiring ESs as well as the success of the net-centric vision itself. The content of this paper is drawn from a MITRE study, sponsored by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks & Information Integration (ASD/NII). The study provides recommendations for guidance on ES SLAs. The study contains an ES SLA Management Framework and a Notional SLA Needs Framework. It provides recommendations on the necessary components or elements of an ES SLA, such as the boundary of control, provider and customer responsibilities, metrics, consumer characterizations, and End-to-End (E2E) solutions.

However, system integrators rarely verify SLA compliance in their proposed composition designs. Instead, SLA compliance is verified after the composed services are deployed in the field. To improve the quality of the composed services, we propose a framework to verify SLA compliance in composed services at design time. The framework re-uses information in business process models to simulate services and verify the non-functional requirements before the service deployment. To demonstrate our framework, we built a prototype using an industrial process simulation engine from IBM WebSphere Business Modeler and integrate it into an industrial service composition tool.

"Integration of security parameters in the service level specification to improve QoS management of secure distributed multimedia services","Duflos, S.; Gay, V.; Kervella, B.; Horlait, E.","Lab. d''Informatique de Paris VI, France","Advanced Information Networking and Applications, 2005. AINA 2005. 19th International Conference on","28-30 March 2005","2005","2","","145","148 vol.2","This paper proposes to integrate security parameters into the service level specification (SLS). Integrating those parameters in the QoS part of the service level agreement (SLA) specification is essential in particular for secure multimedia services since the QoS is negotiated when the multimedia service is deployed. Security mechanisms need to be negotiated at that time when sensible multimedia information is exchanged. In this paper we show that including security parameters in the SLA specification improves the negotiation, deployment and use of the secure multimedia service. The parameters this paper proposes to integrate have the advantage to be understandable by both the end-users and service providers.","1550-445X","0-7695-2249-1","","10.1109/AINA.2005.222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423665","","Authentication;Conference management;Data security;ISO standards;Information security;Intelligent networks;Open systems;Protocols;Quality management;Web and internet services","distributed processing;formal specification;multimedia systems;quality of service;security of data;telecommunication security","QoS management;SLA specification;secure distributed multimedia services;secure multimedia services;security parameter;service level agreement;service level specification","","","","1","","14","","","20050425","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A study of service composition with QoS management","Fung, C.K.; Hung, P.C.K.; Guijun Wang; Linger, R.C.; Walton, G.H.","Eng. & Inf. Technol., Boeing Phantom Works, USA","Web Services, 2005. ICWS 2005. Proceedings. 2005 IEEE International Conference on","11-15 July 2005","2005","","","","724","Quality of service (QoS) management in compositions of services requires careful consideration of QoS characteristics of the services and effective QoS management in their execution. A Web service is a software system that supports interoperable application-to-application interaction over the Internet. Web services are based on a set of XML standards such as simple object access protocol (SOAP). The interactions of SOAP messages between Web services form the theoretical model of SOAP message exchange patterns (MEP). Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL) defines an interoperable integration model that facilitates automated process integration in intra- and inter-corporate environments. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a Web services requestor and provider guaranteeing quantifiable issues at defined levels only through mutual concessions. Based on a prior research work on message detail record (MDR), this paper further proposes a SOAP message tracking model for supporting QoS end-to-end management in the context of WSBPEL and SLA. This paper motivates the study of QoS management in a Web service composition framework with the evolution of a distributed toolkit in an industrial setting.","","0-7695-2409-5","","10.1109/ICWS.2005.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530865","BPEL;CBA;MDR;MEP;OOA;QoS;SLA.;SOA;SOAP;Web services","Delay;Imaging phantoms;Information technology;Quality management;Quality of service;Service oriented architecture;Simple object access protocol;Software systems;Web and internet services;Web services","Internet;XML;access protocols;business data processing;message passing;open systems;quality of service","Internet;QoS management;SOAP;WSBPEL;Web Services Business Process Execution Language;Web service;XML standards;interoperable application-to-application interaction;message detail record;message exchange patterns;quality of service;service-level agreement;simple object access protocol","","","","3","","33","","","20051114","","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider the issue of integration of mobile IP and DiffServ including handoff condition and propose the schemes with a hierarchical agent architecture for supporting QoS in mobile/wireless IP networks. To support DiffServ for mobile hosts, we configure foreign agent to have pre-allocated resources in advance for static service level agreement (SLA) case. In case foreign network has no pre-configured SLA or enough resources for mobile host, we configure new SLA among bandwidth brokers to be set up using dynamic SLA. Also, we propose the signaling and data procedures with DiffServ with respect to fast handoff","1525-3511","0-7803-6596-8","","10.1109/WCNC.2000.904640","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=904640","","Application software;Communication system traffic control;Diffserv networks;IP networks;Intelligent networks;Internet;Portable computers;Quality of service;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks","Internet;land mobile radio;packet radio networks;quality of service;transport protocols","DiffServ;Internet;QoS support;bandwidth brokers;data procedures;differentiated services;dynamic SLA;fast handoff method;foreign agent;foreign network;hierarchical agent architecture;mobile IP;mobile hosts;mobile/wireless IP network;mobile/wireless IP networks;pre-allocated resources;quality of service;service level agreement;signaling procedures","","","","2","1","14","","","20020806","23 Sep 2000-28 Sep 2000","IEEE","","IEEE Conference Publications"

A block parallel FIR structure is introduced with area linear in rate <e1>f</e1> by using parallel nibble-serial multipliers, while classical IIR structures are shown to grow quadratically with <e1>f</e1>. A sizing method is introduced to reduce the multiplier area of direct form IIR filters. Applying parallel multipliers to scattered look-ahead (SLA) is shown to ideally reduce area to <e1>f</e1> lg <e1>f</e1>, but changing parallel data format increases growth to <e1>f</e1><sup>4/3</sup><e1>lg</e1><sup>2/3</sup><e1>f</e1>.
