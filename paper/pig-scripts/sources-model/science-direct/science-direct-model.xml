A reconfiguration platform named Kalimucho has been used on top of a peer-to-peer layer to carry on the whole (re)-deployment process. More importantly, we propose to use this platform which is mainly composed of P2P reconfiguration facilities in order to support conflicts detections, semantic and social-based assembly of relevant adaptation services and customization of quality adaptation paths.

Since a service might be offered under different configurations by various different organizations, sophisticated service selection and negotiation algorithms are required. Policies capture the conditions under which services are offered or requested and thereby constrain the negotiation space. However, current policy languages are ill-suited to realize beneficial trade-offs within a negotiation, since they support only Boolean decisions and cannot capture all relevant service information. Therefore, we present a novel policy language in this work that provides two main contributions: (i) we enable the specification of constraints on functional as well as non-functional properties of Web services. The functional properties include data objects and the behaviour, whereas the non-functional properties include QoS attributes. (ii) Given such constraints, we show how the concept of utility function policies can be used to define cardinal preferences over functional as well as non-functional properties. This is required to rank Web service offers, define their prices, and consequently to realize automated negotiations between service providers and requesters.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Agarwal, Vikas</author><author>Chafle, Girish</author><author>Dasgupta, Koustuv</author><author>Karnik, Neeran</author><author>Kumar, Arun</author><author>Mittal, Sumit</author><author>Srivastava, Biplav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthy: A system for end to end composition of web services</title><secondary-title>Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web</full-title></periodical><pages>311-339</pages><volume>3</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>application integration</keyword><keyword>ontology</keyword><keyword>planning</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>semantic web</keyword><keyword>service composition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.websem.2005.09.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1570826805000223</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The demand for quickly delivering new applications is increasingly becoming a business imperative today. However, application development is often done in an ad hoc manner resulting in poor reuse of software assets and longer time-to-delivery. Web services have received much interest due to their potential in facilitating seamless business-to-business or enterprise application integration. A web service composition system can help automate the process, from specifying business process functionalities, to developing executable workflows that capture non-functional (e.g. Quality of Service (QoS)) requirements, to deploying them on a runtime infrastructure. Intuitively, web services can be viewed as software components and the process of web service composition similar to software synthesis. In addition, service composition needs to address the build-time and runtime issues of the integrated application, thereby making it a more challenging and practical problem than software synthesis. However, current solutions based on business web services (using WSDL, BPEL, SOAP, etc.) or semantic web services (using ontologies, goal-directed reasoning, etc.) are both piecemeal and insufficient. We formulate the web service composition problem and describe the first integrated system for composing web services end to end, i.e., from specification to deployment. The proposed solution is based on a novel two-staged composition approach that addresses the information modeling aspects of web services, provides support for contextual information while composing services, employs efficient decoupling of functional and non-functional requirements, and leads to improved scalability and failure handling. We also present Synthy, a prototype of the service composition system, and demonstrate its effectiveness with the help of an application scenario from the telecom domain.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ahsan, Syed Muhammad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A framework for QoS computation in web service and technology selection</title><secondary-title>Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces</full-title></periodical><pages>714-720</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>converged networks</keyword><keyword>qos computation</keyword><keyword>service-oriented computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.csi.2005.06.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920548905000966</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There is a global trend of convergence of voice, video and data. Industry is facing a major shift from circuit-based voice networks to packet-based converged networks. In the last few years, data networks have been growing at much faster rate than voice networks, mainly due to the growth of Internet. As a result of this trend, more and more data are being sent over Data Networks (Voice over IP, Voice over Frame Relay, and Voice over ATM). The standards used are SOAD, WSDL, and UDDI. The emerging Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm promises to enable businesses and organizations to collaborate in an unprecedented way by means of standard web services. To support rapid and dynamic composition of services in this paradigm, web services that meet requesters' functional requirements must be able to be located from a large and constantly changing number of service providers based on their Quality of Service (QoS). In order to enable quality-driven web service selection, we need an open, secure and fair framework to evaluate the QoS of a vast number of web services. The fair computation and enforcing of web services should have minimal overhead but yet able to achieve sufficient trust by both service requesters and providers. In this paper I present our open and fair QoS computation model for web service selection.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alférez, G.H.</author><author>Pelechano, V.</author><author>Mazo, R.</author><author>Salinesi, C.</author><author>Diaz, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic adaptation of service compositions with variability models</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>24-47</pages><volume>91</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2013.06.034</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121213001465</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services run in complex contexts where arising events may compromise the quality of the whole system. Thus, it is desirable to count on autonomic mechanisms to guide the self-adaptation of service compositions according to changes in the computing infrastructure. One way to achieve this goal is by implementing variability constructs at the language level. However, this approach may become tedious, difficult to manage, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a semantically rich variability model to support the dynamic adaptation of service compositions. When a problematic event arises in the context, this model is leveraged for decision-making. The activation and deactivation of features in the variability model result in changes in a composition model that abstracts the underlying service composition. These changes are reflected into the service composition by adding or removing fragments of Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) code, which can be deployed at runtime. In order to reach optimum adaptations, the variability model and its possible configurations are verified at design time using Constraint Programming. An evaluation demonstrates several benefits of our approach, both at design time and at runtime.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ardagna, Danilo</author><author>Mirandola, Raffaela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Journal of Systems and Software Per-flow optimal service selection for Web services based processes</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1512-1523</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>composite web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2010.03.045</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2010.03.045</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the development of the Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) paradigm, flexible business processes can be defined from independently developed services. Multiple services corresponding to the same functionality but characterized by different Quality of Service (QoS) attributes can be offered by different service providers and the best set of Web services can be selected at run-time in order to maximize the QoS for end users. In the literature many approaches have been proposed for the optimal service selection which is usually performed on a per-request basis, i.e., considering a single process invocation. In this paper we propose a broker-based framework which solves the optimal service selection on a per-flow basis. Multiple applications, defined as different BPEL processes are considered at the same time and multiple requests to the same process are optimized concurrently. Service selection is formulated as a constrained non-linear multi-criteria optimization problem and an heuristic algorithm is proposed to determine a scalable and efficient solution. A comparison with top performing state-of-the-art approaches for a number of different scenarios of interest is also provided. Results show that the overall optimization time reduction which can be achieved by our solution is proportional to the system incoming workload. Order of magnitudes optimization time improvements can be obtained if compared to alternative methods. Moreover, our solution is robust to workload prediction uncertainty.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bai, Xiaoying</author><author>Liu, Yongli</author><author>Wang, Lijun</author><author>Zhong, Peide</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Model-based monitoring and policy enforcement of services</title><secondary-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>1399-1412</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.simpat.2009.06.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1569190X09000860</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Runtime monitoring is necessary for continuous quality assurance of Web Services. Sensors are critical in runtime monitoring to capture the data and detect anomalies. However, sensors in current monitoring systems are usually manually instrumented or hard-coded in the program. It is expensive to implement, and inflexible to change at runtime. The paper extends our previous research on collaborative monitoring and proposes a model-based approach for automatic generating sensors and enforcing policies. Web Services standards WSDL and OWL-S are taken as the models of service interface, workflow, and semantic. Sensors are generated based on the models from two perspectives: (1) dependency analysis of the data, operations, and services with respect to the ontology model of domain concepts and usage context; (2) coverage strategies to decide the specific logic and paths to cover and the data to capture by the monitoring sensors. Policies are defined as a 3-tuple of type, subject and assertion sets and are specified using WS-Policy standards. They are associated to the sensors and enforced at runtime by the policy engine that interoperates with service execution engine to communicate runtime behavior information and verification results. Prototype system is implemented based on the Eclipse platform where sensors are implemented as the listeners to the process execution and instrumented into the middleware including the OWL-S execution engine and SOAP engine. Experiments show that the monitoring results in low overhead of the system performance, reduced effort and enhanced flexibility of sensor instrumentation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baird, R.</author><author>Jorgenson, N.</author><author>Gamble, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Self-adapting workflow reconfiguration</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>510-524</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2010.10.026</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121210002918</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Because web services are highly interoperable, they are capable of providing uniform access to underlying technologies, allowing developers to choose between competing services. Workflow languages, such as BPEL, compose and sequence Web service invocations resulting in meaningful, and sometimes, repeated tasks. Their prevalence means there may be multiple Web services that perform the same operation with some better than others depending on the situation. Their potential for being unavailable at critical workflow execution times forces a reliance on such redundant services. One remedy for unavailability and situational awareness constraints is using quality of service factors and user-directed preferences to assign priorities to workflows and services to perform run-time replacement. In this paper we describe a novel approach to self-adapting workflow reconfiguration. We discuss the implementation of our approach embodied by the Next-generation Workflow Toolkit that supports runtime workflow reconfiguration using BPEL with a commercial workflow engine. A key design feature is the decoupling of user-directed changes regarding service priority from the actual workflow execution, allowing NeWT to effectively manage and recover from workflow changes at any time. We evaluate NeWT by comparing the same example across multiple commercial systems that claim reconfiguration capabilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bandyopadhyay, Anjan</author><author>Si, Tapas</author><author>Mondal, PP</author><author>Mallik, Saurav</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proposed Conceptual Model for Semantically Enabled Web Services Based On QoS</title><secondary-title>Procedia Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>579-583</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>services</keyword><keyword>syntactic and semantic web</keyword><keyword>web service</keyword><keyword>web service model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.protcy.2012.05.092</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212017312003714</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Presently, the service discovery is the process of discovering one or more documents that describe in a particular service. Most of the service discovery mechanisms perform syntactic matching. That means it supports the key word based search. This often leads to poor service discovery result. Another drawback of the existing service discovery mechanism is that the query service matching score is calculated and taking an account only the keywords from the user query's and the terms is the service descriptions. The keyword based service discovery mechanism supported by Universal Description Discovery and Integration (UDDI) and most of the existing service search engines like Yahoo and Google suffer from keyword based search. Firstly it is difficult for the user to obtain the desired services because the number of the retrieved services with respect to the keywords may be huge. Secondly, keywords are insufficient in expressing the semantic concepts and semantically different concepts could possess identical representation (homonyms), which will further low accuracy. This warrants the need to establish an effective and reliable process of web service discovery. This research has emerged to develop methods and model to improve the accuracy of the best web service discovery to match the best service. This paper presents a survey of web service discovery systems, focusing on systems that support either semantics based or syntactic based approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bartolini, Cesare</author><author>Bertolino, Antonia</author><author>Elbaum, Sebastian</author><author>Marchetti, Eda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bringing white-box testing to Service Oriented Architectures through a Service Oriented Approach</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>655-668</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2010.10.024</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016412121000289X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The attractive feature of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is that pieces of software conceived and developed by independent organizations can be dynamically composed to provide richer functionality. The same reasons that enable flexible compositions, however, also prevent the application of some traditional testing approaches, making SOA validation challenging and costly. Web services usually expose just an interface, enough to invoke them and develop some general (black-box) tests, but insufficient for a tester to develop an adequate understanding of the integration quality between the application and the independent web services. To address this lack we propose an approach that makes web services more transparent to testers through the addition of an intermediary service that provides coverage information. The approach, named Service Oriented Coverage Testing (SOCT), provides testers with feedback about how much a service is exercised by their tests without revealing the service internals. In SOCT, testing feedback is offered itself as a service, thus preserving SOA founding principles of loose coupling and implementation neutrality. In this paper we motivate and define the SOCT approach, and implement an instance of it. We also perform a study to asses SOCT feasibility and provide a preliminary evaluation of its viability and value.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ben Mokhtar, Sonia</author><author>Georgantas, Nikolaos</author><author>Issarny, Valérie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>COCOA: COnversation-based service COmposition in pervAsive computing environments with QoS support</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1941-1955</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>dynamic service composition</keyword><keyword>pervasive computing</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>semantic web</keyword><keyword>service oriented architectures</keyword><keyword>workflow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2007.03.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121207000726</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Pervasive computing environments are populated with networked services, i.e., autonomous software entities, providing a number of functionalities. One of the most challenging objectives to be achieved within these environments is to assist users in realizing tasks that integrate on the fly functionalities of the networked services opportunely according to the current pervasive environment. Towards this purpose, we present COCOA, a solution for COnversation-based service COmposition in pervAsive computing environments with QoS support. COCOA provides COCOA-L, an OWL-S based language for the semantic, QoS-aware specification of services and tasks, which further allows the specification of services and tasks conversations. Moreover, COCOA provides two mechanisms: COCOA-SD for the QoS-aware semantic service discovery and COCOA-CI for the QoS-aware integration of service conversations towards the realization of the user task’s conversation. The distinctive feature of COCOA is the ability of integrating on the fly the conversations of networked services to realize the conversation of the user task, by further meeting the QoS requirements of user tasks. Thereby, COCOA allows the dynamic realization of user tasks according to the specifics of the pervasive computing environment in terms of available services and by enforcing valid service consumption.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Benharref, Abdelghani</author><author>Dssouli, Rachida</author><author>Serhani, Mohamed Adel</author><author>Glitho, Roch</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficient traces’ collection mechanisms for passive testing of Web Services</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>362-374</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2008.04.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095058490800058X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web Services are a novel approach for business-to-business interactions. Their management, especially fault and performance management, is becoming necessary for their success and emergence. Nowadays, this management is platform-dependent and does not allow third parties to be involved. In this paper, we consider management of Web Services by passive testing where the tester itself is a Web Service. We propose different architectures for observation of simple and composite Web Services. We also study a set of online traces collection mechanisms and discuss their performances in terms of required CPU/RAM resources and introduced network overhead. These performances are then maximized by selecting best locations of observers. Observation considers both functional and non-functional (QoS) properties of Web Services. The paper presents also our experiments using different observation architectures and traces collection mechanisms while observing a simple and a composite Web Service.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bistarelli, Stefano</author><author>Santini, Francesco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Nonmonotonic Soft Concurrent Constraint Language for SLA Negotiation</title><secondary-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>147-162</pages><volume>236</volume><keywords><keyword>nonmonotonicity</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>service level agreement</keyword><keyword>soft constraint logic programming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.entcs.2009.03.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1571066109000991</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present an extension of the Soft Concurrent Constraint language that allows the nonmonotonic evolution of the constraint store.

We present this framework as a possible solution to the management of resources (e.g. web services and network resource allocation) that need a given Quality of Service (QoS). The QoS requirements of all the parties should converge, through a negotiation process, on a formal agreement defined as the Service Level Agreement, which specifies the contract that must be enforced. c-semirings are the algebraic structures that we use to model QoS metrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blake, M Brian</author><author>Cummings, David J</author><author>Bansal, Ajay</author><author>Kona Bansal, Srividya</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Workflow composition of service level agreements for web services</title><secondary-title>Decision Support Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Decision Support Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>234-244</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Service level agreements</keyword><keyword>Service-oriented computing</keyword><keyword>Web services</keyword><keyword>service level agreements</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dss.2012.01.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.01.017</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167923612000437</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service-oriented architecture enables an environment where businesses can expose services for use by their collaborators and their peer organizations. In this dynamic environment, organizations require the use of service level agreements (SLAs) to assure the quality of service (QoS) standards of services provided by their collaborators. In an ad-hoc workflow scenario, a business may need to perform real-time composition of existing services in response to consumer requests. In this work, we suggest that, in parallel to traditional web service composition, the business must also compose the existing SLAs in order to ensure the service levels that must be guaranteed to new consumers. Ultimately, this approach to SLA composition must align with the overarching principles of the provider and the priorities of the consumer. In this paper, we introduce a model and representations of service level agreement attributes appropriate for managing a service provider's expectations when adding new partners. Our evaluations suggest that the SLA composition can efficiently run concurrently with traditional service composition.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blanco, Eduardo</author><author>Cardinale, Yudith</author><author>Vidal, María-Esther</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Non-Chronological Backtracking Unfolding Algorithm for Transactional Web Service Composition</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>888-893</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>non-chronological backtracking</keyword><keyword>transactional properties</keyword><keyword>web service composition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2012.06.117</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050912004747</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Current Web technologies provide the basis for publishing and composing large number of Web Services which are char–acterized by functional, non-functional, and transactional properties. Although the research community has proposed several approaches to effciently solve problems as service selection and composition, some of these solutions may be incomplete, i.e., they may fail producing a solution when solutions exist. In this paper we propose a non-chronological backtracking strategy which is implemented in a state-of-the-art composition algorithm named PT-SAM, and complete–ness is achieved in the context of transactional web service composition. Empirical results suggest that the proposed approach may overcome the chronological backtracking strategy by up one order of magnitude.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boone, Bas</author><author>Van Hoecke, Sofie</author><author>Van Seghbroeck, Gregory</author><author>Joncheere, Niels</author><author>Jonckers, Viviane</author><author>De Turck, Filip</author><author>Develder, Chris</author><author>Dhoedt, Bart</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SALSA: QoS-aware load balancing for autonomous service brokering</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>446-456</pages><volume>83</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2009.09.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121209002374</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The evolution towards “Software as a Service”, facilitated by various web service technologies, has led to applications composed of a number of service building blocks. These applications are dynamically composed by web service brokers, but rely critically on proper functioning of each of the composing subparts which is not entirely under control of the applications themselves. The problem at hand for the provider of the service is to guarantee non-functional requirements such as service access and performance to each customer. To this end, the service provider typically divides the load of incoming service requests across the available server infrastructure. In this paper we describe an adaptive load balancing strategy called SALSA (Simulated Annealing Load Spreading Algorithm), which is able to guarantee for different customer priorities, such as default and premium customers, that the services are handled in a given time and this without the need to adapt the servers executing the service logic themselves. It will be shown that by using SALSA, web service brokers are able to autonomously meet SLAs, without a priori over-dimensioning resources. This will be done by taking into account a real time view of the requests by measuring the Poisson arrival rates at that moment and selectively drop some requests from default customers. This way the web servers’ load is reduced in order to guarantee the service time for premium customers and provide best effort to default customers. We compared the results of SALSA with weighted round-robin (WRR), nowadays the most used load balancing strategy, and it was shown that the SALSA algorithm requires slightly more processing than WRR but is able to offer guarantees – contrary to WRR – by dynamically adapting its load balancing strategy.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buccafurri, F.</author><author>De Meo, P.</author><author>Fugini, M.</author><author>Furnari, R.</author><author>Goy, A.</author><author>Lax, G.</author><author>Lops, P.</author><author>Modafferi, S.</author><author>Pernici, B.</author><author>Redavid, D.</author><author>Semeraro, G.</author><author>Ursino, D.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of QoS in cooperative services for real time applications</title><secondary-title>Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>463-484</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.datak.2008.08.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169023X08001067</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Future complex architectures for Web-Services-based delivery of services and objects require applications able to deal with different levels of Quality of Service (QoS) and able to describe also the quality of the associated object. In order to allow applications adapting in front of degraded quality in a pre-determined way, all the nodes participating in a given business process shall coordinate their efforts in (i) deciding how to deal with service degradation/disruption, and in (ii) managing the overall quality (i.e., not only the Web-Service QoS but also the quality of the objects being delivered through the cooperative process). According to this rationale, one of the main goals of the Quadrantis project has been to investigate how to provide combined quality measurement of services and delivered objects, such as videos, voice, texts, or images. QoS modelling and management according to users’ needs are presented. Users will access services according to QoS Contracts negotiated with service providers, while the streaming content is based on user profiles, to face a more dynamic management of QoS deviations in the Real Time provisioning level. In our approach, applications can request QoS, and react and repair to violations of the terms set forth in contracts or in expected delivery parameters, such as bandwidth or frame rate. To this extent, we present a framework for providing applications and services with QoS adaptation functionality, through the step-wise induction of a monitoring and recovery solutions at both Web-Services and streaming layers. The foundations of the merging between the two layers, which deal with very different aspects and protocols, are based on quality.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buscemi, Maria Grazia</author><author>Montanari, Ugo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QoS negotiation in service composition</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>13-24</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jlap.2010.04.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567832610000172</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service composition in Service Oriented Computing concerns not only integration of heterogeneous distributed applications but also dynamic selection of services. Quality of Service (QoS) plays a key role in service composition as services providing the same functionalities can be differentiated according to their QoS guarantees. At subscription time, a service requester and a provider may sign a contract recording the QoS of the supplied service. The cc-pi calculus has been introduced as a constraint-based model of QoS contracts. In this work we propose a variant of the cc-pi calculus in which the alternatives in a choice rather than being selected non-deterministically have a dynamic priority. Basically, a guard cj:πj in a choice is enabled if the constraint cj is entailed by the store of constraints and the prefix πj can be consumed. Moreover, the j -th branch can be selected not only if the corresponding guard cj:πj is enabled but also if cj is weaker than the constraints ci of the other enabled alternatives. We prove that our choice operator is more general than a choice operator with static priority. Finally, we exploit some examples to show that our prioritised calculus allows arbitrarily complex QoS negotiations and that a static form of priority is strictly less expressive than ours.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Büyüközkan, Gülçin</author><author>Çifçi, Gizem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A combined fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS based strategic analysis of electronic service quality in healthcare industry</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2341-2354</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2011.08.061</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417411011730</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service sector is under pressure to deliver continuing performance and quality improvement while being customer-focused. In recent terms, there exists web based or electronic service quality (e-sq) concept. With the birth of electronic commerce, it has become important to be able to monitor and enhance e-sq. Therefore, this study will examine the e-sq concept and determine the key components of e-sq. The e-sq framework is employed by the aid of service quality (SERVQUAL) methodology as the theoretical instrument. Finally, proposed e-sq framework is illustrated with a web service performance example of healthcare sector in Turkey by using a combined multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology containing fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). The work presented in this paper shows the applicability of the e-sq framework in explaining the complexity of aspects observed in the implementation of healthcare services via internet.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cai, Haibin</author><author>Hu, Xiaohui</author><author>Lü, Qingchong</author><author>Cao, Qiying</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel intelligent service selection algorithm and application for ubiquitous web services environment</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2200-2212</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>artificial neural network</keyword><keyword>context-ware</keyword><keyword>service selection</keyword><keyword>three-term</keyword><keyword>ubiquitous computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2007.12.071</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417407006446</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>It is one of most important problems to choose a most appropriate service for user from all the useable services regardless of user’s location and heterogeneous architecture of underlying software and hardware infrastructure in ubiquitous computing. In order to overcome the shortcomings of blindness and randomicity in traditional service selection algorithm, we propose a novel ANN-based (Artificial Neural Network) service selection algorithm (called the ANNSS algorithm). We adopt a novel method that according to the earlier information of the cooperation between the devices and the context information, an ANN-based evaluation standard for the service quality of service provider is given out so that user can acquire an effective guidance and choose the most appropriate service. At the same time, we improved the traditional BP algorithm based on three-term method (called the TTMBP) consisting of a learning rate (LR), a momentum factor (MF) and a proportional factor (PF) in order to satisfy the requirements of time issue in real-time system. The convergence speed and stability were enhanced by adding the proportional factor. The self-adjusting architecture method is adopted so that a moderate scale of neural network can be obtained. We have implemented the ANNSS algorithm in an actual ubiquitous web services system and fulfilled various simulations. The results of simulation show that the proposed service selection scheme is not only scalable but also efficient, and that the novel BP algorithm based on three-term has high convergence speed and good convergence stability. The novel service selection scheme superior to the traditional service selection scheme without ANNSS. The novel algorithm can exactly choose a most appropriate service in ubiquitous web services environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Canfora, Gerardo</author><author>Di Penta, Massimiliano</author><author>Esposito, Raffaele</author><author>Villani, Maria Luisa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A framework for QoS-aware binding and re-binding of composite web services</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1754-1769</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>composite web services</keyword><keyword>dynamic binding</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>recovery actions</keyword><keyword>service-oriented architectures</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2007.12.792</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121208000046</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>QoS-aware dynamic binding of composite services provides the capability of binding each service invocation in a composition to a service chosen among a set of functionally equivalent ones to achieve a QoS goal, for example minimizing the response time while limiting the price under a maximum value.

Users are increasingly reliant on the Web for up-to-date personal and business information and services. Web architectures able to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) that rules the relationship between users and Web service providers require a large investment in new algorithms and systems for dispatching, load balancing, and information consistency. In this paper, we consider Web cluster architectures composed of multiple back-end server nodes and one front-end dispatcher and we analyze how to provide differentiated service levels to various classes of users.

In workflows or Web processes for e-commerce and Web service applications, suppliers and customers define a binding agreement or contract between the two parties, specifying quality of service (QoS) items such as products or services to be delivered, deadlines, quality of products, and cost of services. The management of QoS metrics directly impacts the success of organizations participating in e-commerce. Therefore, when services or products are created or managed using workflows or Web processes, the underlying workflow engine must accept the specifications and be able to estimate, monitor, and control the QoS rendered to customers. In this paper, we present a predictive QoS model that makes it possible to compute the quality of service for workflows automatically based on atomic task QoS attributes. We also present the implementation of our QoS model for the METEOR workflow system. We describe the components that have been changed or added, and discuss how they interact to enable the management of QoS.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Casado, Rubén</author><author>Younas, Muhammad</author><author>Tuya, Javier</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences Multi-dimensional criteria for testing web services transactions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1057-1076</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcss.2013.01.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2013.01.020</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services (WS) transactions are important in order to reliably compose distributed and autonomous services into composite web services and to ensure that their execution is consistent and correct. But such transactions are generally complex and they require longer processing time, and manipulate critical data. Thus various techniques have been developed in order to perform quality assessment of WS transactions in terms of response time efficiency, failure recovery and throughput. This paper focuses on the testing aspect of WS transactions — another key quality issue that has not been examined in the literature. Accordingly it proposes multi-dimensional criteria for testing the WS transactions. The proposed criteria have the potential to capture the behaviour of WS transactions and to analyse and classify the possible (failure) situations that effect the execution of such transactions. These criteria are used to generate various test cases and to provide (WS transactions) tester with flexibility of adjusting the method in terms of test efforts and effectiveness. The proposed criteria have been designed, implemented and evaluated through a case study and a number of experiments have been performed. The evaluation shows that these criteria have the capability to effectively generate test cases for testing WS transactions as well as enable tester to decide on the trade-off between test efforts and the quality.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chassaing, Maxime</author><author>Fontanel, Jonathan</author><author>Lacomme, Philippe</author><author>Ren, Libo</author><author>Tchernev, Nikolay</author><author>Villechenon, Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A GRASP×ELS approach for the job-shop with a web service paradigm packaging</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>544-562</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2013.07.080</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417413005678</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is well known for its complexity as an NP-hard disjunctive scheduling problem. The problem addressed in this paper is JSSPs with an objective of minimizing makespan while satisfying a number of hard constraints. An efficient GRASP × ELS approach is introduced for solving this problem. The efficiency is evaluated using the widely known 40 Laurence’s instances which encompass medium and large scale instances. The computational results prove that the proposed method competes with the best published methods in both quality of results and computational time. Recently, Web services have generated great interest in researchers. Such application architecture is based on the client–server model using existing Internet protocols and open standards. It provides new approaches to optimization methods. The proposed GRASP × ELS is packaged into a Web Service (WS), i.e., it offers for the research community an open access to our optimization approach. Moreover, the proposed web service can be even included in research future works with a very small programming effort. To favor utilization of the web service and to prove the facility in which the service could be used, we provide an example in Java proving that it is possible to obtain in less than 10 min a client application using the different methods exposed by this web service. Such usage extends to classical library inclusion in program with the difference that a method is called in the client side and represents an execution on the server. The Web Service paradigm is a new approach in spreading algorithms and therefore this paper stands at the crossroads of optimization research community and the web service community expectations. The GRASP × ELS provided in the web service, is a state of the art method which competes with previously published ones and which has the advantage of being available for free, in any languages, everywhere contributing in spreading operational research contribution.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, Yiyu</author><author>Das, Amitayu</author><author>Gautam, Natarajan</author><author>Wang, Qian</author><author>Sivasubramaniam, Anand</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pricing-based strategies for autonomic control of web servers for time-varying request arrivals</title><secondary-title>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence</full-title></periodical><pages>841-854</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>admission control</keyword><keyword>pricing</keyword><keyword>revenue</keyword><keyword>slowdown</keyword><keyword>web-server</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.engappai.2004.09.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0952197604001125</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper considers a web service that receives requests from customers at various rates at different times. The objective is to build an autonomic system that is tuned to different settings based on the varying conditions, both internally and externally. The authors have developed revenue-based pricing as well as admission control strategies, taking into account quality of service issues such as slow down and fairness aspects. Three heuristics are developed in this paper to address the pricing and admission control problem. The three heuristics are: (1) static pricing combined with queue-length-threshold-based admission control; (2) dynamic optimal pricing with no admission control; and (3) static pricing with nonnegative-profit-based admission control. These three strategies are benchmarked against a fourth strategy (called—do nothing) with no pricing and no admission control. The paper evaluates and compares their performance, implementability and computational complexity. The conclusion is that the web server revenue can be significantly increased by appropriately turning away customers via pricing or admission control mechanisms, and this can be done autonomically in the web server.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Choi, Cheol Rim</author><author>Jeong, Hwa Young</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A broker-based quality evaluation system for service selection according to the QoS preferences of users</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>553-566</pages><volume>277</volume><keywords><keyword>selecting of web service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.141</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025514002540</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The quality offered by web services is becoming the utmost priority and various studies to search and select web services according to their Quality of Service (QoS) as well as functionality have been proposed. However, most studies have applied each attribute independently as a constraint to select a web service. Each attribute has a different priority weight that represents the degree of influence on the overall quality and the priority weight can be changed depending on the purpose of the quality evaluation or the subjectivity of the user. Here, we propose a system that calculates the priority weights for each quality attribute according to the QoS preference of a user easily and consistently and reflects the weights in selecting the web service. To calculate the weights, we apply a pairwise comparison matrix and an eigenvector of the matrix. Through the proposed algorithms and system, users can easily perform the process calculating the weights and select the web services according to their QoS preference. We implement the broker-based quality evaluation system and the simulation results show that the weights of the quality attributes and the quality score ranking of the web services are changed according to users’ preferences.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chunlin, Li</author><author>Layuan, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimization decomposition approach for layered QoS scheduling in grid computing</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</full-title></periodical><pages>816-832</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>grid computing</keyword><keyword>layered qos scheduling</keyword><keyword>optimization decomposition</keyword><keyword>optimization modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sysarc.2007.01.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1383762107000392</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The paper presents optimization decomposition based layered Quality of Service (QoS) scheduling for computational grid. Cross layer joint QoS scheduling is studied by considering the global problem as decomposed into three sub-problems: resource allocation at the fabric layer, service composing at the collective layer, and user satisfaction degree at the application layer. The paper proposes a complete solution from optimization modeling, Lagrange relaxation based decomposition, to solutions for each sub-problem Lagrange relaxation based decomposition. These aspects match the vertical organization of the considered grid system: each layer trade with adjacent layers to find a global optimum of the whole grid system. Through multi-layer QoS joint optimization approach, grid global QoS optimization can be achieved. The cross layer policy produces an optimal set of grid resources, service compositions, and user’s payments at the fabric layer, collective layer and application layer, respectively, to maximize global grid QoS. The owner of each layer obtains inputs from other layers, tries to maximize its own utility and provides outputs back to other layers. This iterative process lasts until presumably all layers arrive at the same solution.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chunlin, Li</author><author>Layuan, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploiting composition of mobile devices for maximizing user QoS under energy constraints in mobile grid</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>654-670</pages><volume>279</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2014.04.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025514004654</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper presents exploiting composition of mobile devices for maximizing user QoS under energy constraints in mobile grid. Mobile device service composition process includes two parts: mobile device service provisioning through device service market and mobile device resource allocation through device resource market. Interactions among mobile grid user agent, mobile device service agent and mobile device resource agent are mediated by means of market mechanisms. Mobile device service composition optimization maximizes the interests of mobile grid user agent, mobile device service agent and mobile device resource agent. Utility function is used to specify QoS requirement of mobile grid users and benefit of mobile device resource agents. The problem of services composition of mobile devices is formulated by utility optimization. The paper also presents a mobile grid services composition algorithm to maximize user QoS under energy constraint. In the simulation, the performance evaluation of proposed algorithm for services composition of mobile devices is conducted and compared with other related works.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chunlin, Li</author><author>Layuan, Li</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cross-layer optimization policy for QoS scheduling in computational grid</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>258-284</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2006.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804506000828</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804506000828</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper presents a cross-layer quality of service (QoS) optimization policy for computational grid. Efficient QoS management is critical for computational grid to meet heterogeneity and dynamics of resources and users’ requirements. There are different QoS metrics at different layers of computational grid. To improve perceived QoS by end users over computational grid, QoS supports can be addressed in different layers, including application layer, collective layer, fabric layer and so forth. The paper tackles cross-layer grid QoS optimization as optimization decomposition, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem. The proposed policy produces an optimal set of grid resources, service compositions and user's payments at the fabric layer, collective layer and application layer respectively to maximize global grid QoS. The cross-layer optimization problem decomposes into three subproblems: grid resource allocation problem, service composing and user satisfaction degree maximization problem, all of which interact through the optimal variables for capacities of grid resources and service demand. In order to coordinate the subproblems, cross-layer QoS feedback mechanism is established to ensure different layer interactions. The simulations are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed policy.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Conti, Marco</author><author>Gregori, Enrico</author><author>Lapenna, Willy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Client-side content delivery policies in replicated web services: parallel access versus single server approach</title><secondary-title>Performance Evaluation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Performance Evaluation</full-title></periodical><pages>137-157</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>39 050 315 2593</keyword><keyword>39 050 315 3059</keyword><keyword>client-side strategies</keyword><keyword>content delivery policies</keyword><keyword>corresponding author</keyword><keyword>fax</keyword><keyword>performance evaluation</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>replication</keyword><keyword>simulation</keyword><keyword>tel</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.peva.2004.07.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166531604000719</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The widespread use of web applications pushes for faster and more reliable web services. Several techniques have been developed to address web-service reliability, and to provide a better Quality of Service (QoS) for Internet users. A relatively new technique is web-services geographical replication. Geographical replication can be achieved with both server-side and client-side policies. Among these policies, in this paper we contrasted, qualitatively and quantitatively (via simulation), the most promising client-side techniques: one parallel strategy and one single-server strategy. The aim of our study was to determine the pros and cons of the two approaches (single server versus parallel servers) with the aim of identifying the best solutions for content-delivery systems. We analytically quantified the overhead introduced by the selected parallel strategy and proposed two extensions of the parallel strategy to reduce its overhead still maintaining the simplicity of the original approach. The selected strategies are evaluated when: (i) a consistent number of clients adopt the same strategy, (ii) clients download both small and/or big files from the web servers, and (iii) clients are connected to the Internet via a slow-link connection. Results of our analysis pointed out the problems of adopting a parallel strategy in a widespread fashion, and indicated the scenarios in which a parallel strategy may be advantageous. As a result of our study, we proposed a hybrid strategy that combines the parallel and the single server strategies. The hybrid strategy applies either the parallel or the single-server strategy depending on the load and system conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corredor, Iván</author><author>Martínez, José F.</author><author>Familiar, Miguel S.</author><author>López, Lourdes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware for deploying pervasive services</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>562-576</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>internetworking architecture</keyword><keyword>knowledge management</keyword><keyword>service-oriented middleware</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2011.05.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804511001111</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Many applications and services have emerged in the frame of new Internet of Things paradigm. This novel view has opened the Web services to a variety of devices especially to tiny and resource-constrained devices. Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks belong to that kind of devices. Those networks have become one of the more promising technologies to take part in the Future Internet. However, the integration of Sensor and Actuator Networks into the Service Cloud is a hard challenge requiring specific new architectures and protocols. This paper presents a middleware approach addressing this important issue. A Knowledge-Aware and Service-Oriented Middleware (KASOM) for pervasive embedded networks is proposed. The major aim of KASOM is to offer advanced and enriched pervasive services to everyone connected to Internet. In this sense, KASOM implements mechanisms and protocols which allow managing the knowledge generated in pervasive embedded networks in order to expose it to Internet users in a readable way. General functional requirements of embedded sensor and actuator platforms have been taken into account when designing KASOM, with special attention in energy consumption, memory and bandwidth. The KASOM evaluation and validation will be demonstrated through a real Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network deployment based on integral healthcare services in a sanatorium.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Costa, Evandro</author><author>Ferreira, Rafael</author><author>Brito, Patrick</author><author>Bittencourt, Ig Ibert</author><author>Holanda, Olavo</author><author>Machado, Aydano</author><author>Marinho, Tarsis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A framework for building web mining applications in the world of blogs: A case study in product sentiment analysis</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>4813-4834</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.135</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417411014588</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recently there has been much interest in electronic commerce applications that use data mining techniques to explore datasets in the social media context. However, most of the applications have already been developed in an ad hoc manner, mainly, due to the lack of adequate tools, yielding difficulties in customizing applications and requesting high time consuming for constructing and maintaining these applications. This work addresses these problems and proposes a software framework for building Web mining applications in the blog world. The architecture of the proposed framework combines the use of blog crawling and data mining algorithms, in order to provide a complete and flexible solution for building general-purpose Web mining applications. The framework flexibility allows some important customizations, such as the construction of adapters for reading text from different blogs, and the use of different pre-processing techniques and data mining algorithms. In order to improve the efficacy of information extraction from blogs, ontology is used in the blog’s description. For this, there are software agents responsible for tracking and indexing blogs related to a specific tag and for mining blog datasets. Moreover, web services are used for encapsulating existing tools and maximize reuse. This framework has been instantiated in order to be applied for helping the blog users to effectively find out relevant information in the blog world. The focus of this paper is on describing the novel software architecture of the general framework (blog crawling and data mining) providing detailed information about the data mining sub-framework, which uses the semantic web services technology for automating service composition and consists on the main research contribution. A case study of an e-commerce application for analyzing the user’s sentiment regarding specific products is reported and its results considers the effort reduction when creating a web mining application by using the proposed integrated frameworks and existing data mining tools, as well as a qualitative analysis related to quality aspects of the developed application, such as the evolution impact.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crasso, Marco</author><author>Mateos, Cristian</author><author>Zunino, Alejandro</author><author>Campo, Marcelo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>EasySOC: Making web service outsourcing easier</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>452-473</pages><volume>259</volume><keywords><keyword>Dependency injection</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Service outsourcing</keyword><keyword>Service-oriented computing</keyword><keyword>Text mining</keyword><keyword>service-oriented computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2010.01.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025510000277</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service-oriented computing has been widely recognized as a revolutionary paradigm for software development. Despite the important benefits this paradigm provides, current approaches for service-enabling applications still lead to high costs for outsourcing services with regard to two phases of the software life cycle. During the implementation phase, developers have to invest much effort into manually discovering services and then providing code to invoke them. Mostly, the outcome of the second task is software containing service-aware code, therefore it is more difficult to modify and to test during the maintenance phase. This paper describes EasySOC, an approach that aims to decrease the costs of creating and maintaining service-oriented applications. EasySOC combines text mining, machine learning, and best practices from component-based software development to allow developers to quickly discover and non-invasively invoke services. We evaluated the performance of the EasySOC discovery mechanism using 391 services. In addition, through a case study, we conducted a comparative analysis of the software technical quality achieved by employing EasySOC versus not using it.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cruz, Sérgio a.B.</author><author>Monteiro, Antonio M.V.</author><author>Santos, Rafael</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated geospatial Web Services composition based on geodata quality requirements</title><secondary-title>Computers &amp; Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers &amp; Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>60-74</pages><volume>47</volume><keywords><keyword>service-oriented architecture</keyword><keyword>soa</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.020</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098300411004134</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service-Oriented Architecture and Web Services technologies improve the performance of activities involved in geospatial analysis with a distributed computing architecture. However, the design of the geospatial analysis process on this platform, by combining component Web Services, presents some open issues. The automated construction of these compositions represents an important research topic. Some approaches to solving this problem are based on AI planning methods coupled with semantic service descriptions. This work presents a new approach using AI planning methods to improve the robustness of the produced geospatial Web Services composition. For this purpose, we use semantic descriptions of geospatial data quality requirements in a rule-based form. These rules allow the semantic annotation of geospatial data and, coupled with the conditional planning method, this approach represents more precisely the situations of nonconformities with geodata quality that may occur during the execution of the Web Service composition. The service compositions produced by this method are more robust, thus improving process reliability when working with a composition of chained geospatial Web Services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dao, Tien Tuan</author><author>Hoang, Tuan Nha</author><author>Ta, Xuan Hien</author><author>Tho, Marie Christine Ho Ba</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Knowledge-based personalized search engine for the Web-based Human Musculoskeletal System Resources (HMSR) in biomechanics.</title><secondary-title>Journal of biomedical informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of biomedical informatics</full-title></periodical><pages>160-73</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Artificial Intelligence</keyword><keyword>Computer Graphics</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Information Storage and Retrieval</keyword><keyword>Internet</keyword><keyword>Musculoskeletal System</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Semantics</keyword><keyword>User-Computer Interface</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23149160</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jbi.2012.11.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23149160</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Human musculoskeletal system resources of the human body are valuable for the learning and medical purposes. Internet-based information from conventional search engines such as Google or Yahoo cannot response to the need of useful, accurate, reliable and good-quality human musculoskeletal resources related to medical processes, pathological knowledge and practical expertise. In this present work, an advanced knowledge-based personalized search engine was developed. Our search engine was based on a client-server multi-layer multi-agent architecture and the principle of semantic web services to acquire dynamically accurate and reliable HMSR information by a semantic processing and visualization approach. A security-enhanced mechanism was applied to protect the medical information. A multi-agent crawler was implemented to develop a content-based database of HMSR information. A new semantic-based PageRank score with related mathematical formulas were also defined and implemented. As the results, semantic web service descriptions were presented in OWL, WSDL and OWL-S formats. Operational scenarios with related web-based interfaces for personal computers and mobile devices were presented and analyzed. Functional comparison between our knowledge-based search engine, a conventional search engine and a semantic search engine showed the originality and the robustness of our knowledge-based personalized search engine. In fact, our knowledge-based personalized search engine allows different users such as orthopedic patient and experts or healthcare system managers or medical students to access remotely into useful, accurate, reliable and good-quality HMSR information for their learning and medical purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Database, How Does</author><author>Work, Provider</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Database as Web Services Provider Service</title></titles><periodical/><pages>899-943</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2004</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://Database as Web Services Provider Service.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Deng, Shuiguang</author><author>Huang, Longtao</author><author>Xu, Guandong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social network-based service recommendation with trust enhancement</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>8075-8084</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.012</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417414004102</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Given the increasing applications of service computing and cloud computing, a large number of Web services are deployed on the Internet, triggering the research of Web service recommendation. Despite of service QoS, the use of user feedback is becoming the current trend in service recommendation. Likewise in traditional recommender systems, sparsity, cold-start and trustworthiness are major issues challenging service recommendation in adopting similarity-based approaches. Meanwhile, with the prevalence of social networks, nowadays people become active in interacting with various computers and users, resulting in a huge volume of data available, such as service information, user-service ratings, interaction logs, and user relationships. Therefore, how to incorporate the trust relationship in social networks with user feedback for service recommendation motivates this work. In this paper, we propose a social network-based service recommendation method with trust enhancement known as RelevantTrustWalker. First, a matrix factorization method is utilized to assess the degree of trust between users in social network. Next, an extended random walk algorithm is proposed to obtain recommendation results. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, experiments on a real-world dataset are conducted and experimental results indicate that the quality of the recommendation and the speed of the method are improved compared with existing algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Diamadopoulou, Vassiliki</author><author>Makris, Christos</author><author>Panagis, Yannis</author><author>Sakkopoulos, Evangelos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Techniques to support Web Service selection and consumption with QoS characteristics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>108-130</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>algorithms</keyword><keyword>documentation</keyword><keyword>management</keyword><keyword>measurement</keyword><keyword>modified wsdl</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2006.03.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804506000282</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This work proposes a Web Service (WS) discovery model in which the functional and non-functional requirements are taken into account during service discovery.

It is able to take advantage of quality information located into a Web Service description language description file that might be located in a proprietary universal description, discovery and integration registry server or in an independent URL. Moreover, it implements a database supported WS intermediary (Broker) that it is also possible to store quality of service (QoS) information for WSs.

Without an accurate prediction of service reliability, any unexpected failure can disrupt service. The majority of existing models use static data collected prior to the release of the software. These types of models may predict the reliability of the software as it was during the data collection phase. However, online service software is continuously evolving, and their behaviors can be changed by the runtime usage. Thus, the prediction made by static data can be inaccurate. We present an approach to tackle this challenge by taking into account software runtime behavior in our reliability prediction. We used a data mining tool, Daikon, to collect likely invariants of the software to capture its states in the runtime. This runtime information is then used to compute the reliability of the software by using our port-based reliability model.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Doumbouya, Mamadou Bilo</author><author>Kamsu-Foguem, Bernard</author><author>Kenfack, Hugues</author><author>Foguem, Clovis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Telemedicine using mobile telecommunication: Towards syntactic interoperability in teleexpertise</title><secondary-title>Telematics and Informatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Telematics and Informatics</full-title></periodical><pages>648-659</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.tele.2014.01.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0736585314000148</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Telemedicine allows collaborative activities between health professionals for the deployment of medical procedures carried out remotely by means of device using information and communication technologies.

Web services composition is a concept of integrating component services to conduct complex business transactions based on functionality and performance constraints. With the rapid growth of Web services on the Internet, the services owing the same functionality and different performance become more and more, and different users care for different quality. Therefore, designing effective decision-making method for the personalized composite service has become a fundamental problem for the application based on Web service. In this paper, oriented to the user need with single optimization objective, an efficient algorithm, which consists of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Niche technology, is presented to solve the Web service selection problem.

Therefore, it has attracted many researchers to focus on the research of quality of service (QoS) driven Web service selection in the past years, and many algorithms based on integer programming (IP), mixed integer linear programming (MILP), multi-dimension multi-choice 0–1 knapsack problem (MMKP), Markov decision programming (MDP), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) and so on, have been presented to solve it, respectively. However, these results have not been satisfied at all yet. In this paper, a new cooperative evolution (Co-evolution) algorithm consists of stochastic particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and simulated annealing (SA) is presented to solve the Web service selection problem (WSSP). Furthermore, in view of the practical Web service composition requirements, an algorithm used to resolve the service selection with multi-objective and QoS global optimization is presented based on SPSO and the intelligent optimization theory of multi-objective PSO, which can produce a set of Pareto optimal composite services with constraint principles by means of optimizing various objective functions simultaneously. Experimental results show that Co-evolution algorithm owns better global convergence ability with faster convergence speed. Meanwhile, multi-objective SPSO is both feasible and efficient.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>FanJiang, Yong-Yi</author><author>Syu, Yang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Semantic-based automatic service composition with functional and non-functional requirements in design time: A genetic algorithm approach</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>352-373</pages><volume>56</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2013.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584913002309</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Context In recent years, the composition of ready-made and loosely coupled services into desired systems is a common industrial approach and a widely followed research topic in academia.

The conceptual level of the framework describes how sub-ontologies are extracted and extended with new features, while the architectural level of the framework describes the components of the framework. These components allow the sub-ontology extraction and extension process to be performed using shared resources in the Semantic Grid environment. A prototype of the framework is built using Web Services and a complexity evaluation measure is presented.

Adopting a suitable representation for the business process, we present a mathematical optimization problem which considers several quality-of-service objectives: cost, execution time, reliability, availability and reputation. The web service scheduling problem is formulated as a multiobjective mixed-integer linear optimization problem and solved through a goal optimization method. The optimal solution of the scheduling problem assigns suppliers to all the tasks that comprise the business process, thus establishing the revenues – utilities – of all the suppliers. We then model the interaction between the suppliers as an incomplete information (Bayesian) game: the structure of the game is common knowledge of all the suppliers, but each supplier knows only his/her own utility function. A characterization of the Bayes–Nash equilibria of the game is provided. The paper includes numerical examples.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frankova, Ganna</author><author>Séguran, Magali</author><author>Gilcher, Florian</author><author>Trabelsi, Slim</author><author>Dörflinger, Jörg</author><author>Aiello, Marco</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Journal of Systems and Software Deriving business processes with service level agreements from early requirements</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1351-1363</pages><volume>84</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2011.03.077</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2011.03.077</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>When designing a service-based business process employing loosely coupled services, one is not only interested in guaranteeing a certain flow of work, but also in how the work will be performed. This involves the consideration of non-functional properties which go from execution time and costs, to trust and security. Ideally, a designer would like to have guarantees over the behavior of the services involved in the process. These guarantees are the object of Service Level Agreements. We propose a methodology to design service-based business processes together with Service Level Agreements that guarantee a certain quality of execution, with particular emphasis on security. Starting from an early requirements analysis modeled in the Secure Tropos formalism, we provide a set of user-guided transformations and reasoning tools the final output of which is a set of processes in the form of Secure BPELs together with a set of Service Level Agreements to be signed by participating services. To show the potential impact of the approach, we illustrate the functioning of the methodology on a collaborative procurement scenario derived from the application domain of a research project.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>García Valls, M.</author><author>Basanta Val, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A real-time perspective of service composition: Key concepts and some contributions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</full-title></periodical><pages>1414-1423</pages><volume>59</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Distributed systems</keyword><keyword>Middleware</keyword><keyword>Real time systems</keyword><keyword>Reconfiguration</keyword><keyword>SOA</keyword><keyword>Service composition</keyword><keyword>Service oriented architecture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sysarc.2013.06.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1383762113001239</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Timing predictability of service oriented architectures is challenged by their dynamic nature. Systems have to reconfigure their service-based structure to adapt to the changing environmental requirements. The development of dynamic systems that have timing constraints is currently not possible without imposing some bounds and limitations to the structure and operation of the system. This paper identifies the key factors for achieving time-bounded service-based reconfiguration from a system perspective. The key contribution to bypass the possible complexity of the used task model and associated schedulability analysis algorithm is the provided architectural design that separates the composition from the schedulability. The paper also extends a previous service composition algorithm that provided a feasible solution compliant with the application quality of service criteria (QoS). Due to the design based on the separation of concerns, the algorithm is a simple straight forward graph search guided by values related to the application QoS. The generalized algorithm offers a search mechanism guided through n regions going beyond the four regions model of the previous contribution. Results from the previous algorithm and the n regions version are shown to illustrate the advantages and finer grain results of the latter.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>García, José María</author><author>Ruiz, David</author><author>Ruiz-cortés, Antonio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Web Semantics : Science , Services and Agents on the World Wide Web Improving semantic web services discovery using SPARQL-based repository filtering</title><secondary-title>Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web</full-title></periodical><pages>12-24</pages><volume>17</volume><keywords><keyword>semantic web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.websem.2012.07.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2012.07.002</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Semantic Web Services discovery is commonly a heavyweight task, which has scalability issues when the number of services or the ontology complexity increase, because most approaches are based on Description Logic reasoning. As a higher number of services becomes available, there is a need for solutions that improve discovery performance. Our proposal tackles this scalability problem by adding a preprocessing stage based on two SPARQL queries that filter service repositories, discarding service descriptions that do not refer to any functionality or non-functional aspect requested by the user before the actual discovery takes place. This approach fairly reduces the search space for discovery mechanisms, consequently improving the overall performance of this task. Furthermore, this particular solution does not provide yet another discovery mechanism, but it is easily applicable to any of the existing ones, as our prototype evaluation shows. Moreover, proposed queries are automatically generated from service requests, transparently to the user. In order to validate our proposal, this article showcases an application to the OWL-S ontology, in addition to a comprehensive performance analysis that we carried out in order to test and compare the results obtained from proposed filters and current discovery approaches, discussing the benefits of our proposal.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Geebelen, Dries</author><author>Geebelen, Kristof</author><author>Truyen, Eddy</author><author>Michiels, Sam</author><author>Suykens, Johan a.K.</author><author>Vandewalle, Joos</author><author>Joosen, Wouter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QoS prediction for web service compositions using kernel-based quantile estimation with online adaptation of the constant offset</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>397-424</pages><volume>268</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2013.12.063</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025514000401</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Services offered in a commercial context are expected to deliver certain levels of quality, typically contracted in a service level agreement (SLA) between the service provider and consumer. To prevent monetary penalties and loss of reputation by violating SLAs, it is important that the service provider can accurately estimate the Quality of Service (QoS) of all its provided (composite) services. This paper proposes a technique for predicting whether the execution of a service composition will be compliant with service level objectives (SLOs). We make three main contributions. First, we propose a simulation technique based on Petri nets to generate composite time series using monitored QoS data of its elementary services. This techniques preserves time related information and takes mutual dependencies between participating services into account. Second, we propose a kernel-based quantile estimator with online adaptation of the constant offset to predict future QoS values. The kernel-based quantile estimator is a powerful non-linear black-box regressor that (i) solves a convex optimization problem, (ii) is robust, and (iii) is consistent to the Bayes risk under rather weak assumptions. The online adaption guarantees that under certain assumptions the number of times the predicted value is worse than the actual value converges to the quantile value specified in the SLO. Third, we introduce two performance indicators for comparing different QoS prediction algorithms. Our validation in the context of two case studies shows that the proposed algorithms outperform existing approaches by drastically reducing the violation frequency of the SLA while maximizing the usage of the candidate services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goodall, J</author><author>Horsburgh, J</author><author>Whiteaker, T</author><author>Maidment, D</author><author>Zaslavsky, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A first approach to web services for the National Water Information System</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>404-411</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>1</keyword><keyword>ac-</keyword><keyword>cess a large and</keyword><keyword>cyberinfrastructure</keyword><keyword>for analysis</keyword><keyword>hydrologists and water resource</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>increasing quantity of data</keyword><keyword>interoperability</keyword><keyword>introduction and problem statement</keyword><keyword>managers are able to</keyword><keyword>service-oriented architecture</keyword><keyword>visu-</keyword><keyword>water resources</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2007.01.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364815207000291</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A wealth of freely available hydrologic data are provided by governmental organizations including in situ observations, geospatial data sets, remote sensing products, and simulation model output. Despite having access to this information, much of the data remain underutilized in the hydrologic sciences due in part to the time required to access, obtain, and integrate data from different sources. Web services offer a means for sharing hydrologic data more openly by providing a standard protocol for machine-to-machine communication. We have used this new technology to create a machine accessible interface for the National Water Information System (NWIS), an online repository of historical and real-time streamflow, water-quality, and ground water level observations maintained by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). These services provide a middle-layer of abstraction between the NWIS database and hydrologic analysis systems, allowing such analysis systems to proxy the NWIS server for on-demand data access. We intentionally designed the services to be generic and applicable to other hydrologic databases, in order to provide interoperability between disparate data sources. Performance tests showed that, for time series with less than 1000 observations, the web services layer added minimal overhead in terms of data response time, and development of an example client application for time series visualization highlighted some of the benefits and costs of using web services for data access.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grefen, Paul</author><author>Ludwig, Heiko</author><author>Dan, Asit</author><author>Angelov, Samuil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An analysis of web services support for dynamic business process outsourcing</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1115-1134</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>dynamic business process outsourcing</keyword><keyword>dynamic service outsourcing</keyword><keyword>inter-organizational business process management</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2006.03.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584906000462</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Outsourcing of business processes is crucial for organizations to be effective, efficient and flexible. In fast changing markets, dynamic outsourcing is required, in which business relationships are established and enacted on-the-fly in an adaptive, fine-grained way. This requires automated means for the establishment of outsourcing relationships and for the enactment of services performed in these relationships. Due to wide industry support and their model of loose coupling, Web Services have become the mechanism of choice to interconnect organizations. This paper analyzes Web Services support for the dynamic process outsourcing paradigm. We discuss contract-based outsourcing to define requirements, introduce the Web Services framework and investigate the match between the two. We observe that the framework requires further support for cross-organizational business processes and mechanisms for contracting, QoS management and transaction management. We suggest an approach to fill these gaps based on a business process support application layer implemented on Web Service technology.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haddad, Serge</author><author>Mokdad, Lynda</author><author>Youcef, Samir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bounding models families for performance evaluation in composite Web services</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computational Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computational Science</full-title></periodical><pages>232-241</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>composite web services</keyword><keyword>continuous time markov chains</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jocs.2011.11.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2011.11.003</url><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877750311001050</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One challenge of composite Web service architectures is the guarantee of the Quality of Service (QoS).

The goal is for the composite system to be secure even if the individual components that are developed by multiple organizations might be compromised.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haq, Irfan Ul</author><author>Huqqani, Altaf Ahmad</author><author>Schikuta, Erich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering Hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements</title><secondary-title>DATAK</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>DATAK</full-title></periodical><pages>435-447</pages><volume>70</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Formal model</keyword><keyword>Grid and cloud Computing</keyword><keyword>Service Level Agreement</keyword><keyword>Service composition</keyword><keyword>Workflow management</keyword><keyword>service level agreement</keyword><keyword>work fl ow management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.datak.2011.01.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.datak.2011.01.006</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>IT-based Service Economy requires Service Markets to flourish for the trade of services. A market does not represent a simple buyer-seller relationship, rather it is the culmination point of a complex chain of stake-holders with a hierarchical integration of value along each point in the chain. To enable a Service Economy, Service Markets must be practically realized, which in turn requires an enabling infrastructure to support service value chains and service choreographies resulting from service composition scenarios. In such scenarios, services compose together hierarchically in a producer–consumer manner to form service supply-chains of added value. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are defined at various levels in this hierarchy to ensure the expected quality of service for different stakeholders. Automation of service composition directly implies the aggregation of their corresponding SLAs. In this paper we elaborate on the requirements of hierarchical aggregation of SLAs corresponding to service choreographies leading to business models such as Business Value Networks. During the hierarchical aggregation of SLAs, certain SLA information pertaining to different stakeholders is meant to be restricted and can be only partially revealed to a subset of their business partners. We introduce the concept of SLA-Views to protect such privacy concerns. We then formalize the notion of SLA Choreography and define an aggregation model based on SLA-Views to enable the automation of hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements. The aggregation model has been designed to comply with the WS-Agreement standard.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hristoskova, Anna</author><author>Moeyersoon, Dieter</author><author>Hoecke, Sofie Van</author><author>Verstichel, Stijn</author><author>Decruyenaere, Johan</author><author>Turck, Filip De</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic composition of medical support services in the ICU : Platform and algorithm design details</title><secondary-title>Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine</full-title></periodical><pages>248-264</pages><volume>100</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ireland Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.03.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2010.03.019</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is an extremely data-intensive environment where each patient needs to be monitored 24/7. Bedside monitors continuously register vital patient values (such as serum creatinine, systolic blood pressure) which are recorded frequently in the hospital database (e.g. every 2 min in the ICU of the Ghent University Hospital), laboratories generate hundreds of results of blood and urine samples, and nurses measure blood pressure and temperature up to 4 times an hour. The processing of such large amount of data requires an automated system to support the physicians’ daily work. The Intensive Care Service Platform (ICSP) offers the needed support through the development of medical support services for processing and monitoring patients’ data. With an increased deployment of these medical support services, reusing existing services as building blocks to create new services offers flexibility to the developer and accelerates the design process. This paper presents a new addition to the ICSP, the Dynamic Composer for Web services. Based on a semantic description of the medical support services, this Composer enables a service to be executed by creating a composition of medical services that provide the needed calculations. The composition is achieved using various algorithms satisfying certain quality of service (QoS) constraints and requirements. In addition to the automatic composition the paper also proposes a recovery mechanism in case of unavailable services. When executing the composition of medical services, unavailable services are dynamically replaced by equivalent services or a new composition achieving the same result. The presented platform and QoS algorithms are put through extensive performance and scalability tests for typical ICU scenarios, in which basic medical services are composed to a complex patient monitoring service.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Huang, Angus F.M.</author><author>Lan, Ci-Wei</author><author>Yang, Stephen J.H.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An optimal QoS-based Web service selection scheme</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>3309-3322</pages><volume>179</volume><issue>19</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2009.05.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002002550900231X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quality-of-service (QoS) in Web services encompasses various non-functional issues such as performance, dependability and security, etc. As more and more Web services become available, QoS capability is becoming a decisive factor to distinguishing services. This study proposes an efficient service selection scheme to help service requesters select services by considering two different contexts: single QoS-based service discovery and QoS-based optimization of service composition. Based on QoS measurement metrics, this study proposes multiple criteria decision making and integer programming approaches to select the optimal service. Experimental results show that the scheme is not only efficient, but also works well for complicated scenarios.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hwang, San-yih</author><author>Lee, Chien-hsiang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reliable Web service selection in choreographed environments : Customer : Vendor : Supplier : Shipper</title><secondary-title>Decision Support Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Decision Support Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1463-1476</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Composite web services</keyword><keyword>Optimization of services composition</keyword><keyword>Quality of services</keyword><keyword>Reliability</keyword><keyword>Web services choreography</keyword><keyword>composite web services</keyword><keyword>web services choreography</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2012.12.017</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Previous research into Web service selection mainly uses an orchestration model, in which a single entity is responsible for the selection and invocation of various Web services. However in many application scenarios, each Web service independently performs a selection, even though achieving the business's goals demands collective, pairwise interactions across the total set of Web services. This study instead considers the Web service selection problem in a choreographed environment, in which each Web service maintains its confidentiality about its collaborators and exchanges only limited amounts of information with its partners. The goal is to maximize the likelihood of completing the entire choreography in a failure-prone environment. Several experiments show that the proposed method performs similarly to a centralized method and better than three distributed Web service selection methods that involve various degrees of information about other services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hwang, San-Yih</author><author>Wang, Haojun</author><author>Tang, Jian</author><author>Srivastava, Jaideep</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A probabilistic approach to modeling and estimating the QoS of web-services-based workflows</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>5484-5503</pages><volume>177</volume><issue>23</issue><keywords><keyword>qos aggregation</keyword><keyword>structural workflow</keyword><keyword>web service composition</keyword><keyword>web service qos</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword><keyword>workflow qos</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2007.07.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025507003295</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services promise to become a key enabling technology for B2B e-commerce. One of the most-touted features of Web services is their capability to recursively construct a Web service as a workflow of other existing Web services. The quality of service (QoS) of Web-services-based workflows may be an essential determinant when selecting constituent Web services and determining the service-level agreement with users. To make such a selection possible, it is essential to estimate the QoS of a WS workflow based on the QoSs of its constituent WSs. In the context of WS workflow, this estimation can be made by a method called QoS aggregation. While most of the existing work on QoS aggregation treats the QoS as a deterministic value, we argue that due to some uncertainty related to a WS, it is more realistic to model its QoS as a random variable, and estimate the QoS of a WS workflow probabilistically. In this paper, we identify a set of QoS metrics in the context of WS workflows, and propose a unified probabilistic model for describing QoS values of a broader spectrum of atomic and composite Web services. Emulation data are used to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ingham, DB</author><author>Caughey, SJ</author><author>Little, MC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Supporting highly manageable Web services</title><secondary-title>Computer Networks and ISDN …</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Networks and ISDN …</full-title></periodical><pages>1405-1416</pages><volume>29</volume><keywords><keyword>dublin core</keyword><keyword>dynamic content</keyword><keyword>management</keyword><keyword>metadata</keyword><keyword>object-oriented</keyword><keyword>web</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year></dates><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169755297000445</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper focuses on the management aspects of Web service provision. We argue that support for manageability has to be considered at the design stage if services are to be capable of delivering high levels of quality of service for their users. Examples of the problems caused by lack of manageability include maintenance operations that necessitate service downtime, or difficulties in ensuring consistency of information. We categorise management issues into those concerning a site as a whole and those pertaining to individual services. Our approach to site management supports the arbitrary distribution of services to machines, allowing the optimum cost/performance configuration to be selected. Services can be easily migrated between machines, resulting in sites that scale, both in terms of the number of services and the number of users. Service management issues may be generalised as supporting evolution, for example, supporting changes to the functionality, the presentation logic, and the overall look and feel of a service. Our approach, based on the separation of functionality and presentation, allows such changes to be performed on-line and ensures that updates are reflected consistency across the various pages of a service, or across services. This approach also facilitates the development of services that utilise dynamic content for service customisations, such as tailoring a service to match the profile of users. Furthermore, all management operations are available through Web-based interfaces, making them accessible to a broad range of users, not only specialist system administrators.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Iosifescu-Enescu, Ionut</author><author>Hugentobler, Marco</author><author>Hurni, Lorenz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Web cartography with open standards – A solution to cartographic challenges of environmental management</title><secondary-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>988-999</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsoft.2009.10.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364815209002898</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The visualization of spatial information in the form of maps is a critical task to facilitate decision making in environmental management. Web Map Services (WMS), Styled Layer Descriptor (SLD) and Symbology Encoding (SE) already created an open framework for Web mapping services. However, from the cartographic point of view, the OGC standards have several limitations for producing high quality cartographic representations. Fortunately, these standards can be cartographically enriched to fulfil the complex visualization requirements coming from environmental management. A solution to creating cartographic visualizations based on open standards was developed in the frame of two major European projects, namely ORCHESTRA (Open Architecture and Spatial Data Infrastructure for Risk Management) and SANY (Sensors Anywhere). For example, the IST – 6th Framework Integrated Project SANY, focuses on interoperability of in situ sensors and sensor networks. In this context, sensors serve as an extreme illustration for the dynamic nature of spatial information that must be represented in the form of maps. The cartographic extensions for the Symbology Encoding (SE) standards allow expressing cartographic rules with spatial operators and advanced feature filtering for layer masking, flexible point symbolization, and patterns and gradients for all spatial features. Furthermore the critical point of creating thematic maps is also solved with extensions for intuitive choropleth and various diagram types generation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeong, Buhwan</author><author>Cho, Hyunbo</author><author>Lee, Choonghyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Expert Systems with Applications On the functional quality of service ( FQoS ) to discover and compose interoperable web services</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems With Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems With Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>5411-5418</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>functional attribute</keyword><keyword>information compatibility</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2008.06.087</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2008.06.087</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite its prevalence, the service-oriented architecture (SOA) still has an imperative challenge to achieve interoperability within and across enterprise applications. Minimal conditions for interoperability are: (1) to discover and plug in proper services for integration and (2) to support for seamless data exchanges between component services. A similarity-based approximate matching is a practical approach for both, in that the service discovery relies on functional matches between a query and service descriptions, and the seamless data exchange is granted by mapping information from a service to others. To these ends, this paper comprehensively investigates functional attributes of web services and their manipulation, and particularly highlights an information compatibility and mapping analysis. The functional quality of service (FQoS) allows service discovery and selection to step forward. Simulation results show that the present FQoS metrics are effective in service discovery.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jeong, SY</author><author>Jo, HG</author><author>Kang, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Remote service discovery and binding architecture for soft real-time QoS in indoor location-based service</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems Architecture</full-title></periodical><pages>1-16</pages><keywords><keyword>service discovery and binding</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.sysarc.2014.01.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383762114000241</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Indoor location-based service (LBS) is generally distinguished from web services that have no physical location and user context. In particular, various resources have dynamic and frequent mobility in indoor environments. In addition, an indoor LBS includes numerous service lookups being requested concurrently and frequently from several locations, even through a network infrastructure requiring high scalability in indoor environments. The traditional centralized LBS approach needs to maintain a geographical map of the entire building or complex in its central server, which can cause low scalability and traffic congestion. This paper presents a self-organizing and fully distributed indoor LBS platform with regional cooperation among devices. A service lookup algorithm based on the proposed distributed architecture searches for the shortest physical path to the nearest service resource. A continuous service binding mechanism guarantees a probabilistic real-time QoS regardless of dynamic and frequent mobility in a soft real-time system such as an indoor LBS. Performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm and platform is compared to the traditional centralized architecture in the experimental evaluation of scalability and real test bed environments.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jiang, Shanshan</author><author>Xue, Yuan</author><author>Schmidt, Douglas C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Minimum disruption service composition and recovery in mobile ad hoc networks</title><secondary-title>Computer Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Networks</full-title></periodical><pages>1649-1665</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>mobile ad hoc network</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.comnet.2008.10.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389128608003411</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The dynamic nature of mobile ad hoc networks poses fundamental challenges to the design of service composition schemes that can satisfy the end-to-end quality of service requirements and minimize the effect of service disruptions caused by dynamic link and node failures. Although existing research on mobile ad hoc networks has focused on improving reliability, little existing work has considered service deliveries spanning multiple components. Moreover, service composition strategies proposed for wireline networks (such as the Internet) are poorly suited for highly dynamic wireless ad hoc networks. This paper proposes a new service composition and recovery framework designed to achieve minimum service disruptions for mobile ad hoc networks. The framework consists of two tiers: service routing, which selects the service components that support the service path, and network routing, which finds the optimal network path that connects these service components. Our framework is based on the disruption index, which is a novel concept that characterizes different service disruption aspects, such as frequency and duration, that are not captured adequately by conventional metrics, such as reliability and availability. Using the definition of disruption index, we formulate the problem of minimum-disruption service composition and recovery (MDSCR) as a dynamic programming problem and analyze the properties of its optimal solution for ad hoc networks with known mobility plan. Based on the derived analytical insights, we present our MDSCR heuristic algorithm for ad hoc networks with uncertain node mobility. This heuristic algorithm approximates the optimal solution with one-step lookahead prediction, where service link lifetime is predicted based on node location and velocity using linear regression. We use simulations to evaluate the results of our algorithm in various network environments. The results validate that our algorithm can achieve better performance than conventional methods.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jrad, Foued</author><author>Tao, Jie</author><author>Brandic, Ivona</author><author>Streit, Achim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>SLA enactment for large-scale healthcare workflows on multi-Cloud</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2014.07.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X14001381</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Computing Clouds offer a new way of using IT facilities including the hardware, storage, applications and networks. The huge resource pool on the Cloud forms an appropriate platform for running applications with both computing and data intensity, like the DNA sequencing workflows. This paper studies the topic of running scientific workflows on multiple Clouds, with the DNA sequencing workflow as a driven application. We focus on the problem of matching the workflow functional and non-functional Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements to the compute and storage services provisioned by underlying Clouds with different service price and quality. We designed an ontological model for a semantic description of the problem and developed a novel utility-based genetic matching algorithm for selecting the Cloud services with respect to the user requirements and the properties of the Clouds. We validated the approach by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with other matching algorithms in executing the DNA sequencing application on a realistic simulation platform.

This goal, achieved by providing the “best” solutions, will not be guaranteed unless an efficient composite service composer is employed to choose an optimal set of required unique services (with respect to user-defined values for quality of service parameters) from the large number of provided services in the pool. Facing a wide service pool, user constraints, and a large number of required unique services in each request, the composer must solve an NP-hard problem. In this paper, CSSICA is proposed to make advances toward the lowest possible service time of composite service; in this approach, the PROCLUS classifier is used to divide cloud service providers into three categories based on total service time and assign a probability to each provider. An improved imperialist competitive algorithm is then employed to select more suitable service providers for the required unique services. Using a large real dataset, experimental and statistical studies are conducted to demonstrate that the use of clustering improved the results compared to other investigated approaches; thus, CSSICA should be considered by the composer as an efficient and scalable approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jula, Amin</author><author>Sundararajan, Elankovan</author><author>Othman, Zalinda</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cloud computing service composition: A systematic literature review</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>3809-3824</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>cloud computing service composition</keyword><keyword>quality of service parameter</keyword><keyword>systematic literature review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2013.12.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417413009925</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The increasing tendency of network service users to use cloud computing encourages web service vendors to supply services that have different functional and nonfunctional (quality of service) features and provide them in a service pool. Based on supply and demand rules and because of the exuberant growth of the services that are offered, cloud service brokers face tough competition against each other in providing quality of service enhancements. Such competition leads to a difficult and complicated process to provide simple service selection and composition in supplying composite services in the cloud, which should be considered an NP-hard problem. How to select appropriate services from the service pool, overcome composition restrictions, determine the importance of different quality of service parameters, focus on the dynamic characteristics of the problem, and address rapid changes in the properties of the services and network appear to be among the most important issues that must be investigated and addressed. In this paper, utilizing a systematic literature review, important questions that can be raised about the research performed in addressing the above-mentioned problem have been extracted and put forth. Then, by dividing the research into four main groups based on the problem-solving approaches and identifying the investigated quality of service parameters, intended objectives, and developing environments, beneficial results and statistics are obtained that can contribute to future research.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karakoc, E.</author><author>Senkul, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Composing semantic Web services under constraints</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>11021-11029</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>semantic web services</keyword><keyword>web service composition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2009.02.098</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417409002462</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web service composition is an inevitable aspect of Web services technology, which solves complex problems by combining available basic services and ordering them to best suit the problem requirements.

Although the cost-effective software engineering of WSbWAs is potentially a very rewarding area, not much work has been done to accomplish short time to market conditions by viewing and dealing with WSbWAs as software products that can be derived from a common infrastructure and assets with a captured specific abstraction in the domain. Both Product Line Engineering (PLE) and Agile Methods (AMs), albeit with different philosophies, are software engineering approaches that can significantly shorten the time to market and increase the quality of products. Using the PLE approach we built, at the domain engineering level, a WSbWA-specific lightweight product-line architecture and combined it, at the application engineering level, with an Agile Method that uses a domain-specific visual language with direct manipulation and extraction capabilities of web services to perform customization and calibration of a product or WSBWA for a specific customer. To assess the effectiveness of our approach we designed and implemented a tool that we used to investigate the return on investment of the activities related to PLE and AMs. Details of our proposed approach, the related tool developed, and the experimental study performed are presented in this article together with a discussion of planned directions of future work.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karatas, Fatih</author><author>Fischer, Lars</author><author>Kesdogan, Dogan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Service composition with consideration of interdependent security objectives</title><secondary-title>Science of Computer Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of Computer Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>1</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scico.2014.06.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167642314002962</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Current approaches for service composition consider security as either a single Quality of Service (QoS) attribute or as several mutually independent quality properties. This view is, however, not adequate, as security objectives are no singletons but are subject to interdependence. Another drawback of these approaches is that partial fulfillment of security objectives, either due to technical or organizational constraints cannot be captured. Formal methods on the other hand are usually limited to a fixed set of security objectives. To bridge this gap, we present an approach to assess the quality of service compositions with regards to interdependent security objectives. Our approach utilizes the notion of structural decomposition which estimates the impact of single quality attributes on a security goal. This allows for the definition of domain models for an arbitrary set of security objectives. As the fulfillment of each security objective is individually measured by a utility value, interdependencies between security objectives can be expressed by a single measure. Furthermore, it allows to express partial fulfillment of security objectives. As each security objective is modeled as a utility function on its own, the model resembles a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem. We present first evaluation results of transforming domain models into MOO problems and tackling them with state-of-the-art genetic algorithms. Furthermore, we give an overview of a support tool for our approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karlsson, Magnus</author><author>Karamanolis, Christos</author><author>Chase, Jeff</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Controllable fair queuing for meeting performance goals</title><secondary-title>Performance Evaluation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Performance Evaluation</full-title></periodical><pages>278-294</pages><volume>62</volume><keywords><keyword>christos karamanolis</keyword><keyword>com</keyword><keyword>controllable systems</keyword><keyword>corresponding author</keyword><keyword>e-mail address</keyword><keyword>hp</keyword><keyword>hpl</keyword><keyword>http</keyword><keyword>karlsson</keyword><keyword>m</keyword><keyword>magnus</keyword><keyword>magnus karlsson</keyword><keyword>performance goals</keyword><keyword>personal</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>url</keyword><keyword>weighted fair queueing</keyword><keyword>www</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.peva.2005.07.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166531605000982</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Computing and storage utilities must control resource usage to meet contractual performance targets for hosted customers under dynamic conditions, including flash crowds and unexpected resource failures. This paper explores properties of proportional share resource schedulers that are necessary for stability and responsiveness under feedback control. It shows that the fairness properties commonly defined for proportional share schedulers using Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) are not preserved across changes to the relative weights of competing request flows. As a result, conventional WFQ schedulers are not controllable by a resource controller that adapts by adjusting the weights. The paper defines controllable fairness properties, presents an algorithm to adjust any WFQ scheduler when the weights change, and proves that the algorithm results in controllable-fair schedulers. The analytic results are confirmed by experimental evaluation using a three-tier Web service and a prototype controllable-fair scheduler called C-SFQ(D). C-SFQ(D) extends concurrency-controlled Start-time Fair Queuing (SFQ(D), which supports proportional sharing in multi-tasking computing resources. The prototype includes an adaptive control system that adjusts the flow weights in C-SFQ(D) to meet latency and throughput targets under a variety of conditions. The experimental results demonstrate the importance of controllable-fair scheduling for feedback control of computing utilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Klug, Hermann</author><author>Kmoch, Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A SMART groundwater portal: An OGC web services orchestration framework for hydrology to improve data access and visualisation in New Zealand</title><secondary-title>Computers &amp; Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers &amp; Geosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>78-86</pages><volume>69</volume><keywords><keyword>CSW</keyword><keyword>Harmonisation</keyword><keyword>Interoperability</keyword><keyword>Metadata</keyword><keyword>SDI</keyword><keyword>WebGIS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cageo.2014.04.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0098300414001022</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transboundary and cross-catchment access to hydrological data is the key to designing successful environmental policies and activities. Electronic maps based on distributed databases are fundamental for planning and decision making in all regions and for all spatial and temporal scales. Freshwater is an essential asset in New Zealand (and globally) and the availability as well as accessibility of hydrological information held by or held for public authorities and businesses are becoming a crucial management factor. Access to and visual representation of environmental information for the public is essential for attracting greater awareness of water quality and quantity matters. Detailed interdisciplinary knowledge about the environment is required to ensure that the environmental policy-making community of New Zealand considers regional and local differences of hydrological statuses, while assessing the overall national situation. However, cross-regional and inter-agency sharing of environmental spatial data is complex and challenging. In this article, we firstly provide an overview of the state of the art standard compliant techniques and methodologies for the practical implementation of simple, measurable, achievable, repeatable, and time-based (SMART) hydrological data management principles. Secondly, we contrast international state of the art data management developments with the present status for groundwater information in New Zealand. Finally, for the topics (i) data access and harmonisation, (ii) sensor web enablement and (iii) metadata, we summarise our findings, provide recommendations on future developments and highlight the specific advantages resulting from a seamless view, discovery, access, and analysis of interoperable hydrological information and metadata for decision making.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kokash, Natallia</author><author>Jaghoori, Mohammad Mahdi</author><author>Arbab, Farhad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Timed Reo Networks to Networks of Timed Automata</title><secondary-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>11-29</pages><volume>295</volume><keywords><keyword>model checking</keyword><keyword>networks of</keyword><keyword>reo coordination language</keyword><keyword>service composition</keyword><keyword>timed automata</keyword><keyword>timed constraint automata</keyword><keyword>uppaal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.entcs.2013.04.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2013.04.004</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Reo coordination language is an extensible graphical notation for component or service coordination wherein independent autonomous software entities exchange data through a connector or a network imposing synchronization and data constraints on those entities. Each connector is formed from a set of binary connectors, called channels, with precise semantics and, thus, amenable to formal verification. However, the development of verification tools for Reo-specific semantic models, namely, constraint automata with its multiple extensions to represent quality of service, time constraints, context-dependent or probabilistic behavior would require years of research and development. A much more promising approach is to exploit already existing verification tools. In this paper, we present a mapping of timed Reo networks to networks of timed automata used for system specification in Uppaal. Uppaal is a state-of-the-art toolset for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems used in many large-scale industrial projects. Our work enables its application to the compositional analysis of timed service-based workflow models specified with Reo.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kubicek, Charles</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applying a Stochastic Model to a Dynamic, QoS Enabled Web Services Hosting Environment</title><secondary-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>77-95</pages><volume>151</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>dynamic resource allocation</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>stochastic modelling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.entcs.2006.03.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1571066106003604</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Data centres which host Web services for other organisations and users in a Grid environment must provide for Quality of Service (QoS) requirements to be specified to ensure deployed services perform as desired. As services hosted by a data centre receive unpredictable rates of demand, servers must be allocated dynamically to service pools that are over utilised to avoid breaking QoS requirements. This work describes how a cost based stochastic model for resource allocation is used in data centre middleware to balance server utilisation, and how the model was used to enable a data centre to meet QoS requirements. The stochastic QoS model is compared to two other QoS models and is shown to be the most effective in a number of experiments.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lakhal, Raja Ben</author><author>Chainbi, Walid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Multi-Criteria Approach for Web Service Discovery</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>609-616</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>multi-criteria approach</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>semantic recommendation</keyword><keyword>uddi</keyword><keyword>web services discovery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><isbn>2167336950</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2012.06.078</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050912004358</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the growth of Web Services number and with the diversification of their types and qualities, the choice of the service that complies with user preference became a fundamental issue.

The existing composition approach to geographical information processing service chain, searches for an optimisation solution and is what can be deemed a “selfish” way. This way leads to problems of conflict amongst concurrent tasks and decreases the performance of all service chains. In this study, a non-cooperative game-based mathematical model to analyse the competitive relationships between tasks, is proposed. A best response function is used, to assure each task maintains utility optimisation by considering composition strategies of other tasks and quantifying conflicts between tasks. Based on this, an iterative algorithm that converges to Nash equilibrium is presented, the aim being to provide good convergence and maximise the utilisation of all tasks under concurrent task conditions. Theoretical analyses and experiments showed that the newly proposed method, when compared to existing service composition methods, has better practical utility in all tasks.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Jun</author><author>Zheng, Xiao-Lin</author><author>Chen, Song-Tao</author><author>Song, William-Wei</author><author>Chen, De-ren</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An efficient and reliable approach for quality-of-service-aware service composition</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>238-254</pages><volume>269</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2013.12.015</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025513008657</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the rapidly increasing number of independently developed Web services that provide similar functionalities with varied quality of service (QoS), service composition is considered as a problem in the selection of component services that are in accordance with users’ QoS requirements; a practice known as the QoS-aware service composition problem. However, current solutions are unsuitable for most real-time decision-making service composition applications required to obtain a relatively optimal result within a reasonable amount of time. These services are also unreliable (or even risky) given the open service-oriented environment. In this paper, we address these problems and propose a novel heuristic algorithm for an efficient and reliable selection of trustworthy services in a service composition. The proposed algorithm consists of three steps. First, a trust-based selection method is used to filter untrustworthy component services. Second, convex hulls are constructed to reduce the search space in the process of service composition. Finally, a heuristic global optimization approach is used to obtain the near-optimal solution. The results demonstrate that our approach obtains a close-to-optimal and reliable solution within a reasonable computation time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Li, Wenfeng</author><author>Zhong, Ye</author><author>Wang, Xun</author><author>Cao, Yulian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Resource virtualization and service selection in cloud logistics</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>1696-1704</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Cloud computing</keyword><keyword>Cloud logistics</keyword><keyword>Particle Swarm Optimization</keyword><keyword>Resource virtualization</keyword><keyword>Service selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2013.02.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S108480451300057X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cloud computing and Internet of Things have promoted a new logistics service mode, i.e., the cloud logistics mode.

Before composing services together, the most important thing is to find optimal candidate service instances compliant with non-functional requirements. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is known as an effective and efficient algorithm, which is widely used in this process. However, the premature convergence and diversity loss of PSO always results in suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose an accurate sub-swarms particle swarm optimization (ASPSO) algorithm by adopting parallel and serial niching techniques. The ASPSO algorithm locates optimal solutions by using sub-swarms searching grid cells in which the density of feasible solutions is high. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the accuracy of the standard PSO algorithm in searching the optimal solution of service selection problem.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Chia-Feng</author><author>Sheu, Ruey-Kai</author><author>Chang, Yue-Shan</author><author>Yuan, Shyan-Ming</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A relaxable service selection algorithm for QoS-based web service composition</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1370-1381</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2011.06.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584911001571</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web Services are emerging technologies that enable application to application communication and reuse of autonomous services over Web. Composition of web services is a concept of integrating individual web services to conduct complex business transactions based on functionality and performance constraints Objective To satisfy user requirements, technologies of Quality of service (QoS)-based web service composition (QWSC) are widely used to build complex applications by discovering the best-fit web services in term of QoS. Method In this paper, a QoS-based service selection (RQSS) algorithm is proposed to help composite web application development by discovering feasible web services based on functionalities and QoS criteria of user requirements. The RQSS recommends prospective service candidates to users by relaxing QoS constraints if no suitable or available web service could exactly fulfill user requirements. Results A generic framework is implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of RQSS by adapting WS-BPEL standards, and can be reused for QoS-based web composition applications. Conclusion The experimental results show that the RQSS algorithm indeed performs well and increases the system availability and reliability.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Szu-Yin</author><author>Lai, Chin-Hui</author><author>Wu, Chih-Heng</author><author>Lo, Chi-Chun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A trustworthy QoS-based collaborative filtering approach for web service discovery</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>217-228</pages><volume>93</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2014.01.036</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121214000442</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Many network services which process a large quantity of data and knowledge are available in the distributed network environment, and provide applications to users based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Web services technology. Therefore, a useful web service discovery approach for data and knowledge discovery process in the complex network environment is a very significant issue. Using the traditional keyword-based search method, users find it difficult to choose the best web services from those with similar functionalities. In addition, in an untrustworthy real world environment, the QoS-based service discovery approach cannot verify the correctness of the web services’ Quality of Service (QoS) values, since such values guaranteed by a service provider are different from the real ones. This work proposes a trustworthy two-phase web service discovery mechanism based on QoS and collaborative filtering, which discovers and recommends the needed web services effectively for users in the distributed environment, and also solves the problem of services with incorrect QoS information. In the experiment, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiment results show that the proposed method can accurately recommend the needed services to users, and improve the recommendation quality.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Wei-Li</author><author>Lo, Chi-Chun</author><author>Chao, Kuo-Ming</author><author>Godwin, Nick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-group QoS consensus for web services</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>223-243</pages><volume>77</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcss.2010.01.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002200001000005X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>QoS has been considered as a significant factor for web service marketing and selection. The interpretation of QoS value from web service consumers and providers would be very different. However, a large group of web service participants with different backgrounds may have difficulties in reaching consensus on the values of multi-dimensional web service QoS, so they may have to be clustered in multi-groups in order to improve effectiveness and efficiency. The similarity of clustered fuzzy QoS dispositions as well as their preference order over these attributes should be analyzed to form a multi-groups consensus framework. A soft multi-groups clustering approach could be adopted to prevent opinions from being excluded unintentionally. The group boundaries and similarity thresholds which are used for clustering and analyzing fuzzy QoS opinions can be moderated dynamically according to the feedback from the internal learning mechanism and the web service consumers. As a result, a model for marketing web services based on multi-group consumers' QoS consensus, the FMG-QCMA (Fuzzy Multi-Groups based QoS Consensus Moderation Approach), is proposed to meet the above requirements. The proposed FMG-QCMA is also evaluated through a case study to demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in relation to an existing framework, QCMA (QoS Consensus Moderation Approach).</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lin, Wei-Li</author><author>Lo, Chi-Chun</author><author>Chao, Kuo-Ming</author><author>Younas, Muhammad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consumer-centric QoS-aware selection of web services</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>211-231</pages><volume>74</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>fuzzy logic</keyword><keyword>qos consensus</keyword><keyword>service selection</keyword><keyword>web service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcss.2007.04.009</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022000007000505</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There exist many web services which exhibit similar functional characteristics. It is imperative to provide service consumers with facilities for selecting required web services according to their non-functional characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, the selection process is greatly complicated by the distinct views of service providers and consumers on the services QoS. For instance, they may have distinct views of the service reliability—wherein a consumer considers that a service is reliable if its success rate is higher than 99%, while a provider may consider its service as reliable if its success rate is higher than 90%. The aim of this paper is to resolve such conflicts and to ensure consensus on the QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. It proposes a QoS Consensus Moderation Approach (QCMA) in order to perform QoS consensus and to alleviate the differences on QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. The proposed approach is implemented as a prototype tool and is tested on a case study of a hotel booking web service. Experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly improves the service selection process in a dynamic and uncertain environment of web services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Min</author><author>Wang, Mingrui</author><author>Shen, Weiming</author><author>Luo, Nan</author><author>Yan, Junwei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A quality of service (QoS)-aware execution plan selection approach for a service composition process</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1080-1089</pages><volume>28</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2011.08.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X11002172</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The quality of service (QoS)-aware service composition (QSC) problem is to find an execution plan of a service composition process which can ensure that the quality of service meets given user requirements.

In such a system, events that encapsulate state snapshots of a running system are generated by monitoring components. Hence, an event correlation service is necessary for correlating monitored events from multiple sources. The requirements for the event correlation raise two challenges: to seamlessly integrate event correlation services with other services and applications; and to provide reliable event management with minimal delay. This paper describes our experience in the design and implementation of an event correlation service. The design encompasses an event correlator and an event proxy that are integrated with an architecture for adaptive middleware components. The implementation utilizes the common-based event (CBE) specification and stateful Web service technologies to support the deployment of the event correlation service in a distributed architecture. We evaluate the performance of the overall solution in a test bed and present the results in terms of the trade-off between the flexibility and the performance overhead of the architecture.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Luo, Yuan-sheng</author><author>Qi, Yong</author><author>Hou, Di</author><author>Shen, Lin-feng</author><author>Chen, Ying</author><author>Zhong, Xiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel heuristic algorithm for QoS-aware end-to-end service composition</title><secondary-title>Computer Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1137-1144</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.comcom.2010.02.028</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140366410001039</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Many works have been carried out to find the efficient algorithms for QoS-aware service composition in recent years.

With the advent of high-capacity smart mobile devices and ubiquitous presence of wireless communications, service composition in wireless environments starts picking up momentum. While the majority of the know-how from service composition in wired fixed networks is still applicable to service composition in wireless environments, wireless networks also impose their own features that need to be specifically taken into consideration during service engineering process. To this end, this paper proposes a network-aware algorithm for service composition where network features such as network availability and delay are considered during service composing process. These network metrics incorporate with other non-network QoS parameters such as price and reputation, that are usually utilized in service composition in the current literature. Together these metrics specify the QoS constraints that need to be satisfied by a successful service composition, which is formulated as a multi-dimension multi-choice 0–1 knapsack problem (MMKP) in this paper. The evaluation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and also indicate the impact of the network parameters such as delay on the performance of service composition.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ma, Yue</author><author>Zhang, Chengwen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quick convergence of genetic algorithm for QoS-driven web service selection</title><secondary-title>Computer Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Networks</full-title></periodical><pages>1093-1104</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>convergence</keyword><keyword>genetic algorithm</keyword><keyword>qos-aware</keyword><keyword>stability</keyword><keyword>web service selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.comnet.2007.12.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389128607003489</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A novel quickly convergent population diversity handling genetic algorithm (CoDiGA) is presented for web service selection with global Quality-of-Service (QoS) constraints. CoDiGA is characterized by good stability and quick convergence. In CoDiGA, an enhanced initial population policy and an evolution policy are proposed based on population diversity and a relation matrix coding scheme. The integration of the two policies overcomes shortcomings resulting from randomicity of genetic algorithm, such as slow convergence, great variance among the running results, soaring overhead along with increasing size of composition. The simulation results on web service selection with global QoS constraints have shown that prematurity was overcomed effectively, and convergence and stability of genetic algorithm were improved greatly.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Maamar, Z.</author><author>Narendra, N.C.</author><author>Sattanathan, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards an ontology-based approach for specifying and securing Web services</title><secondary-title>Information and Software Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>441-455</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>composition</keyword><keyword>context</keyword><keyword>ontology</keyword><keyword>security</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2005.05.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950584905000819</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the increasing popularity of Web services and increasing complexity of satisfying needs of users, there has been a renewed interest in Web services composition. Composition addresses the case of a user request that cannot be satisfied by any available Web service, whereas a composite service obtained by integrating Web services might be used. Because Web services originate from different providers, their composition faces the obstacle of the context heterogeneity of Web services. An unawareness or poor consideration of this heterogeneity during Web services composition and execution result in a lack of the quality and relevancy of information that permits tracking the composition, monitoring the execution, and handling exceptions. This paper presents an ontology-based approach for context reconciliation. The approach also focuses on the security breaches that threaten the integrity of the context of Web services, and proposes appropriate means to achieve this integrity.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahdavi-Hezavehi, S</author><author>Galster, Matthias</author><author>Avgeriou, Paris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability in quality attributes of service-based software systems: A systematic literature review</title><secondary-title>Information and Software …</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information and Software …</full-title></periodical><pages>320-343</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.infsof.2012.08.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2012.08.010</url><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584912001772</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Variability is the ability of a software artifact (e.g., a system, component) to be adapted for a specific context, in a preplanned manner. Variability not only affects functionality, but also quality attributes (e.g., security, performance). Service-based software systems consider variability in functionality implicitly by dynamic service composition. However, variability in quality attributes of service-based systems seems insufficiently addressed in current design practices. Objective We aim at (a) assessing methods for handling variability in quality attributes of service-based systems, (b) collecting evidence about current research that suggests implications for practice, and (c) identifying open problems and areas for improvement. Method A systematic literature review with an automated search was conducted. The review included studies published between the year 2000 and 2011. We identified 46 relevant studies. Results Current methods focus on a few quality attributes, in particular performance and availability. Also, most methods use formal techniques. Furthermore, current studies do not provide enough evidence for practitioners to adopt proposed approaches. So far, variability in quality attributes has mainly been studied in laboratory settings rather than in industrial environments. Conclusions The product line domain as the domain that traditionally deals with variability has only little impact on handling variability in quality attributes. The lack of tool support, the lack of practical research and evidence for the applicability of approaches to handle variability are obstacles for practitioners to adopt methods. Therefore, we suggest studies in industry (e.g., surveys) to collect data on how practitioners handle variability of quality attributes in service-based systems. For example, results of our study help formulate hypotheses and questions for such surveys. Based on needs in practice, new approaches can be proposed.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Makris, Christos</author><author>Panagis, Yannis</author><author>Sakkopoulos, Evangelos</author><author>Tsakalidis, Athanasios</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Efficient and adaptive discovery techniques of Web Services handling large data sets</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>480-495</pages><volume>79</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>adaptive web services</keyword><keyword>dynamic discovery</keyword><keyword>uddi</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2005.06.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016412120500110X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Attempts have been made concerning the search and finding of a Web Service based on keywords and descriptions.

This aims at selecting the optimal composed service from all possible service combinations regarding user's end-to-end quality requirements. Existing solutions often employ the global optimization approach, which does not show promising performance. Also, the complexity of such methods extensively depends on the number of available web-services, which continuously increase along with the growth of the Internet. Besides, the local optimization approaches have been rarely utilized, since they may violate the global constraints. In this paper, we propose a top-down structure, named quality constraints decomposition (QCD) here, to decompose the global constraints into the local constraints, using the genetic algorithm (GA). Then the best web service for each task is selected through a simple linear search. In contrast to existing methods, the QCD approach mainly depends on a limited set of tasks, which is considerably less complex, especially in the case of dynamically distributed service composition. Experimental results, based on a well-known data set of web services (QWSs), show the advantages of the QCD method in terms of computation time, considering the number of web services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martín, J.a.</author><author>Martinelli, F.</author><author>Pimentel, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthesis of secure adaptors</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>99-126</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>model-based adaptation</keyword><keyword>security verification</keyword><keyword>web service orchestration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jlap.2011.08.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567832611000634</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Security is considered one of the main challenges for software oriented architectures (SOA). For this reason, several standards have been developed around WS-Security. However, these security standards usually hinder interoperability, one of the main pillars of Web service technologies. Software adaptation is a sound solution where an adaptor is deployed in the middle of the communication to overcome signature, behavioural and QoS incompatibilities between services. This is particularly important when dealing with stateful services (such as Windows Workflows or WS-BPEL processes) where any mismatch in the sequence of messages might lead the orchestration to a deadlock situation. We proposed security adaptation contracts as concise and versatile specifications of how such incompatibilities must be solved. Nonetheless, synthesising an adaptor compliant with a given contract is not an easy task where concurrency issues must be kept in mind and security attacks must be analysed and prevented. In this paper, we present an adaptor synthesis, verification and refinement process based on security adaptation contracts which succeeds in overcoming incompatibilities among services and prevents secrecy attacks. We extended the ITACA toolbox for synthesis and deadlock analysis and we integrated it with a variant of CCS, called Crypto-CCS, to verify and refine adaptors based on partial model checking and logical satisfiability techniques.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martín, J.a.</author><author>Pimentel, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contracts for security adaptation</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>154-179</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>3-5</issue><keywords><keyword>model-based adaptation</keyword><keyword>security specification</keyword><keyword>web service orchestration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jlap.2010.07.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567832610000317</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Security is considered to be one of the main challenges as regards the widespread application of Service Oriented Architectures across organisations. WS-Security, and its successive extensions, have emerged to fulfil this need, but these approaches hinder the loose-coupling among services, therefore constraining their reusability and replaceability. Software adaptation is a sound solution to overcome the incompatibilities in interface, behaviour and security constraints among stateful services. However, programming adaptors from scratch is a tedious and error-prone task where special care must be given to concurrency and security issues. In this work, we propose to use security adaptation contracts that allow us to express and adapt the security requirements of the services and their orchestration. Given a security adaptation contract and the behavioural description of the services (such as BPEL processes or Windows Workflows), we can generate the protocol of the orchestrator that complies with the security requirements (confidentiality, integrity and authenticity), while overcoming incompatibilities at the signature, behaviour and security QoS levels. The formalisation behind security adaptation contracts has other applications such as security policy negotiation and automatic security protocol verification.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mcheick, Hamid</author><author>Deladiennee, Louis</author><author>Wajnberg, Mickael</author><author>Martin, Benoit</author><author>Abi-Khalil, Marc</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Universal Connector Framework for Pervasive Computing Using Cloud Technologies</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>141-148</pages><volume>34</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2014.07.072</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050914009272</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Today, software architecture has a vital role in achieving quality goals for large scale distributed software systems which is made up of components and connectors. Especially, software development mainly consists of composing re-usable components. The main issue in this approach resides in the difficulty to make these heterogeneous components communicate with each other smoothly, especially in mobile and pervasive computing area. These components can be replaced, dropped or added easily using injection of control mechanism (IoC). In this work, we propose and validate a universal connector framework that allows, through a web service interface using cloud technologies, diverse software components and mobile devices communicate with each other. For example, components and devices in pervasive systems can exchange context information, and analyze them to deduce new rules. As a proof of concept, we apply this connector in a mobile messenger context and shows our results.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melo, ACV de</author><author>Silveira, Paulo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving data perturbation testing techniques for Web services</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>600-619</pages><volume>181</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2010.09.030</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025510004846</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The widespread use of service-oriented architectures (SOAs) and Web services in commercial software requires the adoption of development techniques to ensure the quality of Web services.

This paper considers business processes composed of activities that are supported by service providers. The structure of a business process may be expressed by languages such as BPEL and allows for constructs such as sequence, switch, while, flow, and pick. This paper considers the problem of finding the set of service providers that minimizes the total execution time of the business process subject to cost and execution time constraints. The problem is clearly NP-hard. However, the paper presents an optimized algorithm that finds the optimal solution without having to explore the entire solution space. This algorithm can be used to find the optimal solution in problems of moderate size. A heuristic solution is also presented. Thorough experimental studies, based on random business processes, demonstrate that the heuristic algorithm was able to produce service provider allocations that result in execution times that are only a few percentage points (less than 2.5%) worse than the allocations obtained by the optimal algorithm while examining a tiny fraction of the solution space (tens of points versus millions of points).</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mezni, Haithem</author><author>Chainbi, Walid</author><author>Ghedira, Khaled</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>AWS-Policy: An Extension for Autonomic Web Service Description</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>915-920</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>autonomic computing</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>registries</keyword><keyword>self-</keyword><keyword>soa</keyword><keyword>uddi</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword><keyword>ws-policy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2012.06.122</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050912004796</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the last years, the need for integrating QoS to service oriented architecture has become a significant factor for managing service-based systems. In addition, combining self-* and policy-based management has major advantages since it reduces complexity management and effectively drives self-adaptation of Web services. Current service oriented architecture does not support policy-based self-management. To allow this, the description of autonomic Web services (AWS) must not be limited to functional and non-functional data. Indeed, QoS data are not sufficient to effectively drive the self-adaptation process. In addition, providers must participate in the self-adaptation process as they are aware of the capabilities and requirements of their published services and the exceptions that may occur. In this paper, we propose a rich information model that allows describing autonomic Web services based not only on QoS data but also on additional information such as service specific adaptation actions. We extend WS-Policy to specify services related data. UDDI is also extended to support policy-based self-management.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mitrevski, Pece J</author><author>Hristoski, Ilija S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Behavioral-based performability modeling and evaluation of e-commerce systems</title><secondary-title>Electronic Commerce Research and Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronic Commerce Research and Applications</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.elerap.2014.06.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1567422314000337</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Assuring high quality of web services, especially regarding service reliability, performance and availability of e-commerce systems (unified under the term performability), has turned into an imperative of the contemporary way of doing business on the Internet. Recognizing the fact that customers’ online shopping behavior is largely affecting the conduct of e-commerce systems, the paper promotes a customer-centric, holistic approach: customers are identified as the most essential “subsystem” with a number of important, but less well-understood behavioral factors. The proposed taxonomy of customers and the specification of operational profiles is a basis to building predictive models, usable for evaluating a range of performability measures. The hierarchical composition of sub-models utilizes the semantic power of deterministic and stochastic Petri nets, in conjunction with discrete-event simulation. A handful of variables are identified in order to turn performability measures into business-oriented performance metrics, as a cornerstone for conducting relevant server sizing activities.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Di Modica, Giuseppe</author><author>Tomarchio, Orazio</author><author>Vita, Lorenzo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic SLAs management in service oriented environments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>759-771</pages><volume>82</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>service level agreement</keyword><keyword>sla</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2008.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121208002586</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The increasing adoption of service oriented architectures across different administrative domains, forces service providers to use effective mechanisms and strategies of resource management in order for them to be able to guarantee the quality levels their customers demands during service provisioning. Service level agreements (SLA) are the most common mechanism used to establish agreements on the quality of a service (QoS) between a service provider and a service consumer. The WS-Agreement specification, developed by the Open Grid Forum, is a Web Service protocol to establish agreements on the QoS level to be guaranteed in the provision of a service. The committed agreement cannot be modified during service provision and is effective until all activities pertaining to it are finished or until one of the signing party decides to terminate it. In B2B scenarios where several service providers are involved in the composition of a service, and each of them plays both the parts of provider and customer, several one-to-one SLAs need to be signed. In such a rigid context the global QoS of the final service can be strongly affected by any violation on each single SLA. In order to prevent such violations, SLAs need to adapt to any possible needs that might come up during service provision. In this work we focus on the WS-Agreement specification and propose to enhance the flexibility of its approach. We integrate new functionality to the protocol that enable the parties of a WS-Agreement to re-negotiate and modify its terms during the service provision, and show how a typical scenario of service composition can benefit from our proposal.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mohanty, Ramakanta</author><author>Ravi, V</author><author>Patra, M.R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Web-services classification using intelligent techniques</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>5484-5490</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2010.02.063</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417410001028</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The web services, a novel paradigm in software technology, have innovative mechanism for rendering services over diversified environment. They promise to allow businesses to adapt rapidly to changes in the business environment and the needs of different customers. The rapid introduction of new web services into a dynamic business environment can adversely affect the service quality and user satisfaction. Consequently, assessment of the quality of web services is of paramount importance in selecting a web service for an application. In this paper, we employed well-known classification models viz., back propagation neural network (BPNN), probabilistic neural network (PNN), group method of data handling (GMDH), classification and regression trees (CART), TreeNet, support vector machine (SVM) and ID3 decision tree (J48) to predict the quality of a web service based on a set of quality attributes. The experiments are carried out on the QWS dataset. We applied 10-fold cross-validation to test the efficacy of the models. The J48 and TreeNet techniques outperformed all other techniques by yielding an average accuracy of 99.72%. We also performed feature selection and found that web-services relevance function (WSRF) is the most significant attribute in determining the quality of a web service. Later, we performed feature selection without WSRF and found that Reliability, Throughput, Successability, Documentation and ResponseTime are the most important attributes in that order. Moreover, the set of ‘if–then’ rules yielded by J48 and CART can be used as an expert system for web-services classification.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moon, Young-Joo</author><author>Silva, Alexandra</author><author>Krause, Christian</author><author>Arbab, Farhad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A compositional model to reason about end-to-end QoS in Stochastic Reo connectors</title><secondary-title>Science of Computer Programming</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of Computer Programming</full-title></periodical><pages>3-24</pages><volume>80</volume><keywords><keyword>coordination language</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scico.2011.11.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167642311002073</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this paper, we present a compositional semantics for the channel-based coordination language Reo that enables the analysis of quality of service (QoS) properties of service compositions. For this purpose, we annotate Reo channels with stochastic delay rates and explicitly model data-arrival rates at the boundary of a connector, to capture its interaction with the services that comprise its environment. We propose Stochastic Reo Automata as an extension of Reo automata, in order to compositionally derive a QoS-aware semantics for Reo. We further present a translation of Stochastic Reo Automata to Continuous-Time Markov Chains (CTMCs). This translation enables us to use third-party CTMC verification tools to do an end-to-end performance analysis of service compositions. In addition, we discuss to what extent Interactive Markov Chains (IMCs) can serve as an alternative semantic model for Stochastic Reo. We show that the semantics of Stochastic Reo cannot be specified compositionally using the product operator provided by IMCs.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ko, Jong Myoung</author><author>Kim, Chang Ouk</author><author>Kwon, Ick-hyun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality-of-service oriented web service composition algorithm and planning architecture</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>2079-2090</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>qos-oriented composition algorithm</keyword><keyword>quality-of-service</keyword><keyword>web service composition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2008.04.044</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121208000952</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the next few decades, it is expected that web services will proliferate, many web services will offer the same services, and the clients will demand more value added and informative services rather than those offered by single, isolated web services. As the result, the problem of synthesizing web services of high quality will be raised as a prominent issue. The clients will face the trouble of choosing or creating composition plans, among numerous possible plans, that satisfy their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Typical QoS properties associated with a web service are the execution cost and time, availability, successful execution rate, reputation, and usage frequency. In engineering perspective, generating the composition plan that fulfills a client’s QoS requirement is a time-consuming optimization problem. To resolve the problem in a timely manner, we propose a constraint satisfaction based web service composition algorithm that combines tabu search and simulated annealing meta-heuristics. As an implementation framework of the algorithm, we suggest a QoS-oriented web service composition planning architecture. The architecture maintains expert made composition schemas in a service category and assists the client as pure user to choose the one he/she wants to use. The main modules of the architecture are composition broker and execution plan optimizer. With the aid of the UDDI server, the composition broker discovers candidate outsourced web services for each atomic process of the selected schema and gathers QoS information on the web services. After that, the execution plan optimizer runs the web service composition algorithm in order to generate a QoS-oriented composition plan. The performance of the algorithm was tested in a simulated environment.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oh, Jeyeon</author><author>Wook, Nam</author><author>Kim, Hoontae</author><author>Min, Yunhong</author><author>Kang, Suk-ho</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic execution planning for reliable collaborative business processes</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>351-361</pages><volume>181</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>collaborative business process</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2010.09.019</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2010.09.019</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Collaborative business processes, implemented and carried out via web services and enabling dynamic interaction among organizations, are becoming more indispensable to competitiveness in the global market. As dynamic collaboration prevails, the quality of service (QoS) of collaborative processes becomes more important. A critical requirement in cases where processes involve long-term activities is to guarantee successful completion within time constraints. In this study, we developed a methodology for dynamic planning of web service execution that imparts reliability to collaborative business processes. In order to ensure that processes successfully execute within time constraints and at minimum cost, the proposed method dynamically modifies execution plans at run-time by means of fault-tolerance techniques. Since generation of an execution plan of minimum cost while guaranteeing successful completion is classified as an NP-hard problem, a heuristic algorithm was developed. Additionally, to compare the proposed algorithm’s performance with those of the branch-and-bound method and the genetic algorithm (GA), a set of experiments was conducted.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oh, Sangyoon</author><author>Fox, Geoffrey C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimizing Web Service messaging performance in mobile computing</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>623-632</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2006.10.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X06001889</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The performance and efficiency of Web Services in conversational and streaming message exchanges can be greatly increased by streaming the message exchange paradigm. In this paper, we describe our design and implementation of a novel approach to message exchange optimization. This area is particularly important for applications in physically constrained mobile computing environments, but there is great potential for other applications. The verboseness of the XML-based SOAP representation imposes possible overheads in mobile Web Service applications. In order to help minimize such overheads, we separate data content from the syntax and use streaming message exchanges. The redundant or static message parts are stored in a shared metadata space—the Context-store. Therefore, the streamed messages themselves are not self descriptive, but the combination of the message and the negotiation captured in the Context-store is self descriptive. We describe our architecture and evaluate our approach by testing the performance of the resulting system. The empirical results show that our framework outperforms conventional Web Services in both conversational and streaming message exchanges with mobile clients. We demonstrate how to find the breakeven point at which our methods overtake conventional SOAP messaging for a particular application.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Okutan, Cagla</author><author>Cicekli, Nihan Kesim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A monolithic approach to automated composition of semantic web services with the Event Calculus</title><secondary-title>Knowledge-Based Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Knowledge-Based Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>440-454</pages><volume>23</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>automatic web service composition</keyword><keyword>semantic web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.knosys.2010.02.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950705110000341</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this paper, a web service composition and execution framework is presented for semantically -annotated web services. A monolithic approach to automated web service composition and execution problem is chosen, which provides some benefits by separating composition and execution phases. An AI planning method using a logical formalism, namely Abductive Event Calculus, is chosen for the composition phase. This formalism allows one to generate a narrative of actions and temporal orderings using abductive planning techniques given a goal. The functional properties of services, namely input/output/precondition/effects (IOPE) are taken into consideration in the composition phase and non-functional properties, namely Quality of Service (QoS) parameters are used in selecting the most appropriate solution to be executed. The repository of OWL-S semantic web services are translated to the Event Calculus axioms and the resulting plans found by the Abductive Event Calculus Planner are converted to graphs. These graphs can be sorted according to a score calculated using the defined quality of service parameters of the atomic services in the composition to determine the optimal solution. The selected graph is converted to an OWL-S file which is executed consequently.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Palanca, Javier</author><author>Navarro, Marti</author><author>García-Fornes, Ana</author><author>Julian, Vicente</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deadline prediction scheduling based on benefits</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>61-73</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>guaranteed processor</keyword><keyword>service-oriented computing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2012.05.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X12001033</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper describes a scheduling algorithm that composes a scheduling plan which is able to predict the completion time of the arriving tasks. This is done by performing CPU booking. This prediction is used to establish a temporal commitment with the client that invokes the execution of the task. This kind of scheduler is very useful in scenarios where Service-Oriented Computing is deployed and the execution time is used as a parameter for QoS. This scheduler is part of an architecture that is based on the Distributed Goal-Oriented Computing paradigm, which allows agents to express their own goals and to reach them by means of service compositions. Moreover, the scheduler is also able to prioritize those tasks which provide greater benefits to the OS. In this work, the scheduler has been designed in several iterations and tested by means of a set of experiments that compare the scheduler algorithm with a representative set of scheduling algorithms.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parejo, José Antonio</author><author>Segura, Sergio</author><author>Fernandez, Pablo</author><author>Ruiz-Cortés, Antonio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QoS-aware web services composition using GRASP with Path Relinking</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>4211-4223</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2013.12.036</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417413010117</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In service oriented scenarios, applications are created by composing atomic services and exposing the resulting added value logic as a service. When several alternative service providers are available for composition, quality of service (QoS) properties such as execution time, cost, or availability are taken into account to make the choice, leading to the creation of QoS-aware composite web services. Finding the set of service providers that result in the best QoS is a NP-hard optimization problem. This paper presents QoS-Gasp, a metaheuristic algorithm for performing QoS-aware web service composition at runtime. QoS-Gasp is an hybrid approach that combines GRASP with Path Relinking. For the evaluation of our approach we compared it with related metaheuristic algorithms found in the literature. Experiments show that when results must be available in seconds, QoS-Gasp improves the results of previous proposals up to 40%. Beside this, QoS-Gasp found better solutions than any of the compared techniques in a 92% of the runs when results must be available in 100 ms; i.e., it provides compositions with a better QoS, implying cost savings, increased availability and reduced execution times for the end-user.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pastrana, J.L.</author><author>Pimentel, E.</author><author>Katrib, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QoS-enabled and self-adaptive connectors for Web Services composition and coordination</title><secondary-title>Computer Languages, Systems &amp; Structures</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Languages, Systems &amp; Structures</full-title></periodical><pages>2-23</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Composition</keyword><keyword>Coordination</keyword><keyword>Ontology</keyword><keyword>Run-time adaptation</keyword><keyword>Web Services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cl.2010.07.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1477842410000242</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper presents a methodology for Web Service composition and coordination based on connectors which are defined by Web Service client and automatically generated by the COMPOSITOR tool we have developed.

In this paper we focus on service-based applications and we propose an adaptation framework that can be used to reduce power consumption according to the observed workload. The adaptation guarantees a trade-off between energy consumption and system performance. The approach is based on the principle of proportional energy consumption obtained by scaling down energy for unused resources, considering both the number of servers switched on and their operating frequencies. Stochastic Petri nets are proposed for the modeling of the framework concerns, their analyses give results about the trade-offs. The application of the approach to a simple case study shows its usefulness and practical applicability.

This provides a challenge for development of training simulators, since simulated actions risk becoming obsolete rapidly and require costly reimplementation. This paper presents the development of a 3D mechanical maintenance training simulator for this context, using a low-cost simulation platform and a software architecture that separates simulation control from simulation visualization, in view of enabling more agile adaptation of simulators. This specific simulator aims to enable technician training to be enhanced with cooperation and context prior to the training phase with actual physical engines. We provide data in support of the feasibility of this approach, describing the requirements that were identified with the Portuguese Air Force, the overall software architecture of the system, the current stage of the prototype, and the outcomes of the first field tests with users.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pishdad, Leila</author><author>Rabiee, Hamid R.</author><author>Mirarmandehi, Nasim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A fair optimization scheduling scheme for IEEE 802.16 networks in multimedia applications</title><secondary-title>Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation</full-title></periodical><pages>167-174</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>broadband wireless access</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jvcir.2009.05.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1047320309000674</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>IEEE 802.16 networks are designed based on differentiated services concept to provide better Quality of Service (QoS) support for a wide range of applications, from multimedia to typical web services, and therefore they require a fair and efficient scheduling scheme. However, this issue is not addressed in the standard. In this paper we present a new fair scheduling scheme which fulfills the negotiated QoS parameters of different connections while providing fairness among the connections of each class of service. This scheme models scheduling as a knapsack problem, where a fairness parameter reflecting the specific requirements of the connections is defined to be used in the optimization criterion. The proposed scheduler is evaluated through simulation in terms of delay, throughput and fairness index. The results show fairness of the scheduling scheme to all connections while the network guarantees for those connections are fulfilled.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qi, Lianyong</author><author>Dou, Wanchun</author><author>Zhang, Xuyun</author><author>Chen, Jinjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A QoS-aware composition method supporting cross-platform service invocation in cloud environment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Computer and System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1316-1329</pages><volume>78</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022000011001619</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With the increasing popularity of cloud computing technologies, more and more service composition processes are enacted and executed in could environment. Compared with the various and approximately infinite application requirements from end users, the web services held by a cloud platform are usually limited. Therefore, it is often a challenging effort to develop a service composition, in such a situation that only part of the functional qualified candidate services could be found inside a cloud platform. In this situation, the absent services will be invocated in a cross-platform way outside the cloud platform. In view of this challenge, a QoS-aware composition method is investigated for supporting cross-platform service invocation in cloud environment. Furthermore, some experiments are deployed to evaluate the method presented in this paper.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rajeswari, M.</author><author>Sambasivam, G.</author><author>Balaji, N.</author><author>Saleem Basha, M.S.</author><author>Vengattaraman, T.</author><author>Dhavachelvan, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Appraisal and analysis on various web service composition approaches based on QoS factors</title><secondary-title>Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of King Saud University - Computer and Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>143-152</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>King Saud University</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jksuci.2013.08.003</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1319157813000281</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services are the internet enabled applications for performing business needs, considered as the platform-independent and loosely coupled. Web service compositions build new services by organizing a set of existing services by providing reusability and interoperability. The research problem in web service composition is to obtain best effective services with the composition of services based on maximum quality of services (QoS) and satisfy the user’s requirements. This study reveals various challenges in the QoS parameter for Web service composition because it is difficult to recognize.

Although, this usage has made life easier in many respects still the problem of finding relevant information persists. A naïve user faces the problem of information overload and continuous flow of new information makes the problem more complex. Furthermore, user′s interests also keeps on changing with time. Several techniques deal with this problem and data mining is widely used among them. Recommender Systems (RSs) assist users in finding relevant information on the web and are mostly based on data mining algorithms. This paper addresses the problem of user requirements changing over a period of time in seeking information on web and how RSs deal with them. We propose a Dynamic Recommender system (DRS) based on evolutionary clustering algorithm. This clustering algorithm makes clusters of similar users and evolves them depicting accurate and relevant user preferences over time. The proposed approach performs an optimization of conflicting parameters instead of using the traditional evolutionary algorithms like genetic algorithm. The algorithm has been empirically tested and compared with standard recommendation algorithms and it shows considerable improvement in terms of quality of recommendations and computation time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rao, Jinghai</author><author>Küngas, Peep</author><author>Matskin, Mihhail</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Composition of Semantic Web services using Linear Logic theorem proving</title><secondary-title>Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>340-360</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>4-5</issue><keywords><keyword>linear logic theorem proving</keyword><keyword>semantic web</keyword><keyword>service composition</keyword><keyword>web service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.is.2005.02.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S030643790500030X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper introduces a method for automatic composition of Semantic Web services using Linear Logic (LL) theorem proving. The method uses a Semantic Web service language (DAML-S) for external presentation of Web services, while, internally, the services are presented by extralogical axioms and proofs in LL. LL, as a resource conscious logic, enables us to capture the concurrent features of Web services formally (including parameters, states and non-functional attributes). We use a process calculus to present the process model of the composite service. The process calculus is attached to the LL inference rules in the style of type theory. Thus, the process model for a composite service can be generated directly from the complete proof. We introduce a set of subtyping rules that defines a valid dataflow for composite services. The subtyping rules that are used for semantic reasoning are presented with LL inference figures. We propose a system architecture where the DAML-S Translator, LL Theorem Prover and Semantic Reasoner can operate together. This architecture has been implemented in Java.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosaci, D.</author><author>Sarné, G.M.L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recommending multimedia web services in a multi-device environment</title><secondary-title>Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>198-212</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.is.2012.08.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306437912001068</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the last years, the Web community has shown a broad interest in Web services that handle multimedia contents. To improve the usability of these services different tools have been proposed in the literature, and in this context agent-based recommender systems appear to be a promising solution. However, the recommender systems presented in the past do not take into account, in their recommendation algorithms, the effect of the device exploited by the user, while it is clear that the same user shows a different behavior in the presence of different devices. This paper tries to give a contribution in this setting, in order to match more accurately user preferences and interests. In particular, a new agent-based system is proposed, whose architecture allows to compute recommendations of multimedia Web services, considering the effect of the currently exploited device. Some experimental results confirm the high quality of the recommendations generated by the proposed approach.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Almeida, Francisco</author><author>Blanco, Vicente</author><author>Delgado, Carlos</author><author>de Sande, Francisco</author><author>Santos, Adrián</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>IDEWEP: Web service for astronomical parallel image deconvolution</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>293-313</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>and the spanish mcyt</keyword><keyword>astronomical</keyword><keyword>contract tin2005-09037-c02-01</keyword><keyword>deconvolution</keyword><keyword>ec</keyword><keyword>feder</keyword><keyword>i</keyword><keyword>i þ d þ</keyword><keyword>image</keyword><keyword>parallel</keyword><keyword>partially supported by the</keyword><keyword>plan nacional de</keyword><keyword>this work has been</keyword><keyword>web service</keyword><keyword>ã corresponding author</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2008.02.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804508000076</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Image restoration is a significant process commonly applied in many research fields. In particular, image deconvolution algorithms play a very important role in the research methodology in astrophysics, where recorded images are frequently submitted to deconvolution processes. In this paper, we introduce a novel image deconvolution algorithm that is competitive in terms of the restored image quality when compared to classical approaches. We present parallelizations of this algorithm to make it competitive in terms of processing speeds as well. We also present the image deconvolution web portal (IDEWEP) that, using web services technologies, primarily aims to make this general parallel deconvolution method accessible through a web interface. Both the quality of the restored images and running times of the sequential and parallel version have been successfully tested in several sequential and parallel architectures. The IDEWEP portal greatly eases the access and use of the parallel algorithm in high performance architectures. As a contribution to the scientific community, open source sequential and parallel codes are provided and can be freely downloaded from our web portal.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saß, Detlef</author><author>Hauger, Simon</author><author>Köhn, Martin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Architecture and scalability of a high-speed traffic measurement platform with a highly flexible packet classification</title><secondary-title>Computer Networks</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Networks</full-title></periodical><pages>810-820</pages><volume>53</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>packet classification</keyword><keyword>passive traffic measurement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.comnet.2008.11.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1389128608003915</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Evolving network technologies, new web services and changing usage patterns continuously change traffic characteristics. But a thorough understanding of the traffic is the basis for many applications in networking. Thus, it is crucial to analyze up-to-date traffic traces collected by passive measurements in many relevant network contexts. As the traces’ quality defines the significance of such analysis, the measured data is required to be complete, temporally accurate and reliable. This is especially challenging for measurements on high-speed links. In this paper, we present a scalable architecture for a high-speed, passive measurement platform for obtaining highly accurate packet traces. Its functional blocks are distributed to a specialized hardware unit and a commodity PC unit according to their specific requirements. For pre-processing, the hardware unit integrates a protocol-aware classification and filtering module which allows an easy definition of classification and filtering rules. We analyze the platform’s scalability and support this by a implementation with current FPGA technology and a standard server PC.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sattanathan, S.</author><author>Narendra, N.C.</author><author>Maamar, Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ontologies for Specifying and Reconciling Contexts of Web Services</title><secondary-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>43-57</pages><volume>146</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>context</keyword><keyword>ontology</keyword><keyword>reconciliation</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.entcs.2005.11.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1571066106000132</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper presents an ontology-based approach for the specification (using OWL-C as a definition language) and reconciliation (using ConWeS as a mediation tool) of contexts of Web services. Web services are independent components that can be triggered and composed for the satisfaction of user needs (e.g., hotel booking). Because Web services originate from different providers, their composition faces the obstacle of the context heterogeneity featuring these Web services. An unawareness of this context heterogeneity during Web services composition and execution results in a lack of the quality and relevancy of information that permits tracking the composition, monitoring the execution, and handling exceptions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schmidt, Ryan</author><author>Simari, Patricio</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consensus meshing</title><secondary-title>Computers &amp; Graphics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers &amp; Graphics</full-title></periodical><pages>488-497</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Consensus algorithms</keyword><keyword>Mesh generation</keyword><keyword>Remeshing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cag.2012.03.030</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0097849312000696</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Consider an algorithm for generating a triangle mesh interpolating a fixed set of 3D point samples, where the generated triangle set varies depending on some underlying parameters. In this paper we treat such an algorithm as a means of sampling the space of possible interpolant meshes, and then define a more robust algorithm based on drawing multiple such samples from this process and averaging them. As mesh connectivity graphs cannot be trivially averaged, we compute triangle statistics and then attempt to find a set of compatible triangles which maximize agreement between the sample meshes while also forming a manifold mesh. Essentially, each sample mesh “votes” for triangles, and hence we call our result a consensus mesh. Finding the optimal consensus mesh is combinatorially intractable, so we present an efficient greedy algorithm. We apply this strategy to two mesh generation processes—ball pivoting and localized tangent-space Delaunay triangulations. We then demonstrate that consensus meshing enables a generic decomposition of the meshing problem which supports trivial parallelization.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, Shrutivandana</author><author>Tantawi, Asser</author><author>Spreitzer, Michael</author><author>Steinder, Malgorzata</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decentralized allocation of CPU computation power for web applications</title><secondary-title>Performance Evaluation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Performance Evaluation</full-title></periodical><pages>1187-1202</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>decentralized resource allocation</keyword><keyword>web resource management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.peva.2010.08.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166531610001112</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>With increasing demand for web services, the efficient management of web server resources is becoming increasingly important for the delivery of a desired quality of service to the customers. The diversity and scale of web services make the task of resource management challenging for several reasons. Since a number of different enterprizes are involved in offering web services to the customers and providing resources (e.g. virtual machines in a cloud) to host service applications, the information in such systems is highly decentralized. In these systems it is difficult for any one entity to have centralized information about the customer service contracts of all service providers and the infrastructure of all server owners. It is also often impossible to know all of above information due to privacy issues of various enterprizes. For these reasons it is desirable to have decentralized resource management in such systems. In this paper we investigate decentralized allocation of Central Processing Unit (CPU) computation power of server nodes among multiple service applications. Each application is provided at multiple grades of service with each grade offering a different average response time for the service. Each application is hosted on a group of server nodes. For a given application placement on the server nodes, the goal is to allocate the CPU computation power of these nodes among the applications so as to maximize the aggregate utility of all applications. We present an analytical formulation of the above problem and propose a decentralized algorithm for solving it. In the proposed algorithm each application and each server node performs local optimization based on its own information and does not need to reveal its private information. It is shown that with limited communication between applications and server nodes, the algorithm obtains an optimum centralized CPU allocation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shen, Jun</author><author>Beydoun, Ghassan</author><author>Low, Graham</author><author>Wang, Lijuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aligning ontology-based development with service oriented systems</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>263-273</pages><volume>32</volume><keywords><keyword>software development life cycle</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2013.08.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X13001702</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This paper argues for placing ontologies at the centre of the software development life cycle for distributed component-based systems and, in particular, for service-oriented systems.

In this paper, we describe two e-science infrastructures: Science and Engineering Applications Grid (SEAGrid) and molecular modeling and parametrization (ParamChem). The SEAGrid is a virtual organization with a diverse set of hardware and software resources and provides services to access such resources in a routine and transparent manner. These essential services include allocations of computational resources, client-side application interfaces, computational job and data management tools, and consulting activities. ParamChem is another e-science project dedicated for molecular force-field parametrization based on both ab-initio and molecular mechanics calculations on high performance computers (HPCs) driven by scientific workflow middleware services. Both the projects share a similar three-tier computational infrastructure that consists of a front-end client, a middleware web services layer, and a remote HPC computational layer. The client is a Java Swing desktop application with components for pre- and post-data processing, communications with middleware server and local data management. The middleware service is based on Axis2 web service and MySQL relational database, which provides functionalities for user authentication and session control, HPC resource information collections, discovery and matching, job information logging and notification. It can also be integrated with scientific workflow to manage computations on HPC resources. The grid credentials for accessing HPCs are delegated through MyProxy infrastructure. Currently SEAGrid has integrated several popular application software suites such as Gaussian for quantum chemistry, NAMD for molecular dynamics and engineering software such as Abacus for mechanical engineering. ParamChem has integrated CGenFF (CHARMM General Force-Field) for molecular force-field parametrization of drug-like molecules. Long-term storage of user data is handled by tertiary data archival mechanisms. SEAGrid science gateway serves more than 500 users while more than 1000 users use ParamChem services such as atom typing and initial force-field parameter guess at present.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shu, Gao</author><author>Rana, Omer F.</author><author>Avis, Nick J.</author><author>Dingfang, Chen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ontology-based semantic matchmaking approach</title><secondary-title>Advances in Engineering Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in Engineering Software</full-title></periodical><pages>59-67</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>description logics</keyword><keyword>matchmaking</keyword><keyword>ontology</keyword><keyword>semantic web</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.advengsoft.2006.05.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0965997806000512</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As a greater number of Web Services are made available, support for service discovery mechanisms become essential. Services can have quite different Quality of Service characteristics (such as their response time when given a particular set of data). A service requestor therefore requires more sophisticated approaches to find a service that meets a particular behavior, because supporting matching between a service request and properties is not straightforward. Matchmaking plays a vital role in this discovery process. We propose a novel matchmaking algorithm to effectively compute the semantic distance of concepts in an ontology. It is based on description logic formalization and reasoning, extends simple subsumption matching found in other approaches and allows match ranking. We have implemented the proposed approach and used the developed prototype in the context of service discovery in the visualization domain.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mendonça, Nabor C.</author><author>Silva, José Airton F.</author><author>Anido, Ricardo O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Client-side selection of replicated web services: An empirical assessment</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1346-1363</pages><volume>81</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>empirical evaluation</keyword><keyword>web service replication</keyword><keyword>web service selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2007.11.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121207003068</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Replicating web services over physically distributed servers can offer client applications a number of QoS benefits, including higher availability and reduced response time. However, selecting the “best” service replica to invoke at the client-side is not a trivial task, as this requires taking into account factors such as local and external network conditions, and the servers’ current workload. This paper presents an empirical assessment of five representative client-side service selection policies for accessing replicated web services. The assessment measured the response time obtained with each of the five policies, at two different client configurations, when accessing a world-wide replicated service with four replicas located in three continents. The assessment’s results were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. In essence, the results show that, in addition to the QoS levels provided by the external network and the remote servers, characteristics of the local client environment can have a significant impact on the performance of some of the policies investigated. In this regard, the paper presents a set of guidelines to help application developers in identifying a server selection policy that best suits a particular service replication scenario.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Singh, Rajeev Pratap</author><author>Pattanaik, K.K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Approach to Composite QoS Parameter based Web Service Selection</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>470-477</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>Ant</issue><keywords><keyword>composition</keyword><keyword>cpn</keyword><keyword>qos modelling</keyword><keyword>reputation</keyword><keyword>web service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2013.06.063</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050913006716</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In any enterprise application Quality of Service (QoS) is an important attribute for selecting a service during the service composition process. Although availability and reliability have been considered as the predominant factors for estimating reputation, two aspects are lacking in the literature. First, their use is limited to composite service level and does not count at the atomic level. Second, their combined effect is not evaluated. Hence, the methodology of estimating reputation and its use for atomic service will have compounding effect on the overall quality of the composite service. We feel, better estimation of QoS can be done with both factors considered together on the simple premise that availability tells about only the probability of that service being up/running, but doesnot tell about its failure trend. In our work we present mathematical modelling of these predominant QoS factors using Markov model and Weibull analysis. A scenario has been simulated using Colored Petri Nets (CPN) to study the behavioral aspects. The outcome of our research is two fold. First, counting on probability of a service being up/running and its failure trend, together, results in a better estimation of its behavior and helps selecting the most appropriate one. Second, this resulted in selection of a service with higher reputation but lower usage cost, as opposed to using a single factor that resulted in higher reputation with higher cost.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sioutas, S</author><author>Sakkopoulos, E</author><author>Drossos, L.</author><author>Sirmakessis, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Balanced distributed web service lookup system</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>149-162</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2006.03.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804506000300</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web Services (WS) constitute an essential factor for the next generation of application integration. An important direction, apart from the optimization of the description mechanism, is the discovery of WS information and WS search engines lookup capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized approach for WS discovery based on a new distributed peer-based approach. Our proposed solution builds upon the Domain Name Service decentralized approach majorly enhanced with a novel efficient lookup up system. In particular, we work with peers that store WS information, such as service descriptions, which are efficiently located using a scalable and robust data indexing structure for Peer-to-Peer networks, the Balanced Distributed Tree (BDT). BDT provides support for processing (a) Exact match Queries of the form “given a key, map the key onto a node” and (b) Range Queries of the form “map the nodes whose keys belong to a given range”. BDT adapts efficiently update queries as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from our theoretical analysis point out that the communication cost of both lookup and update operations scaling in sub-logarithmic (almost double-logarithmic) time complexity on the number of nodes. Furthermore, our system is also robust on failures.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Song, Xudong</author><author>Dou, Wanchun</author><author>Chen, Jinjun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A workflow framework for intelligent service composition</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>627-636</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2010.06.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X10001214</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In practice, service composition and its evaluation are initiated by participant web services’ functional and non-functional attributes. It often consists of functional property-based service location, non-functional property-based quality evaluation, and then a finial executive plan. This scheduling process is often unfolded in a workflow framework. Generally, selecting qualified services and composing them manually are time-consuming and error-prone. In view of this challenge, a workflow framework is presented in this paper for intelligently navigating service composition. This workflow framework consists of two primary processing modules, i.e., Planning Module and CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problems) Solving Module. Taking advantage of services’ functional attributes, Planning Module aims at producing referred composite plans that play as general patterns. CSP Solving Module focuses on selecting qualified services to implement the composite plans, based on their non-functional attributes’ evaluation. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the validity of framework.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sousa, L.S.</author><author>Leite, J.C.B.</author><author>Loques, Orlando</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Green data centers: Using hierarchies for scalable energy efficiency in large web clusters</title><secondary-title>Information Processing Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Processing Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>507-515</pages><volume>113</volume><issue>14-16</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ipl.2013.04.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S002001901300121X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The growth in the demand for web services requires increasing processing capacity to maintain adequate response time to customer requests and, consequently, results in an increase in the energy consumption to support this infrastructure.

However, while saving energy, the quality of service offered to the customers should be maintained above an acceptable minimum level.

While such services are starting to emerge, current proprietary solutions are often expensive, covering only isolated parts of seniors' needs, and lack support for sharing information between services and between users. For developers, the challenge is that it is complex and time consuming to develop high quality, interoperable services, and new techniques are needed to simplify the development and reduce the development costs. This paper provides the complete view of the experiences gained in the MPOWER project with respect to using model-driven development (MDD) techniques for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) system development in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) domain. METHOD: To address this challenge, the approach of the European research project MPOWER (2006-2009) was to investigate and record the user needs, define a set of reusable software services based on these needs, and then implement pilot systems using these services. Further, a model-driven toolchain covering key development phases was developed to support software developers through this process. Evaluations were conducted both on the technical artefacts (methodology and tools), and on end user experience from using the pilot systems in trial sites. RESULTS: The outcome of the work on the user needs is a knowledge base recorded as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) model. This comprehensive model describes actors, use cases, and features derived from these. The model further includes the design of a set of software services, including full trace information back to the features and use cases motivating their design. Based on the model, the services were implemented for use in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) systems, and are publicly available as open source software. The services were successfully used in the realization of two pilot applications. There is therefore a direct and traceable link from the user needs of the elderly, through the service design knowledge base, to the service and pilot implementations. The evaluation of the SOA approach on the developers in the project revealed that SOA is useful with respect to job performance and quality. Furthermore, they think SOA is easy to use and support development of AAL applications. An important finding is that the developers clearly report that they intend to use SOA in the future, but not for all type of projects. With respect to using model-driven development in web services design and implementation, the developers reported that it was useful. However, it is important that the code generated from the models is correct if the full potential of MDD should be achieved. The pilots and their evaluation in the trial sites showed that the services of the platform are sufficient to create suitable systems for end users in the domain. CONCLUSIONS: A SOA platform with a set of reusable domain services is a suitable foundation for more rapid development and tailoring of assisted living systems covering reoccurring needs among elderly users. It is feasible to realize a tool-chain for model-driven development of SOA applications in the AAL domain, and such a tool-chain can be accepted and found useful by software developers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stavropoulos, Thanos G</author><author>Gottis, Konstantinos</author><author>Vrakas, Dimitris</author><author>Vlahavas, Ioannis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>aWESoME: A web service middleware for ambient intelligence</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>4380-4392</pages><volume>40</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2013.01.061</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417413000936</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This work presents a Web Service Middleware infrastructure for Ambient Intelligence environments, named aWESoME. aWESoME is a vital part of the Smart IHU project, a large-scale Smart University deployment. The purpose of the proposed middleware within the project is twofold: for one, to ensure universal, homogeneous access to the system’s functions and secondly, to fulfill functional and non-functional requirements of the system. Namely, the infrastructure itself should consume significantly low power (as it is meant for energy savings in addition to automations), without compromising reliability and fast response time. The infrastructure should enable fast and direct discovery, invocation and execution of services. Finally, on hardware level, the wireless sensor and actuator network should be optimally configured for speed and reliability as well. The proposed solution employs widely used web open standards for description and discovery to expose hardware and software functions and ensure interoperability, even outside the borders of this university deployment. It proposes a straightforward method to integrate low-cost and resource-constrained heterogeneous devices found in the market and a large-scale placement of servers and wireless sensor networks. Different server hardware installations have been evaluated to find the optimum trade-off between response time and power consumption. Finally, a range of client applications that exploit the middleware on different platforms are demonstrated, to prove its usability and effectiveness in enabling, in this scenario, energy monitoring and savings.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Sherry X.</author><author>Zhao, Jing</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A decomposition-based approach for service composition with global QoS guarantees</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>138-153</pages><volume>199</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2012.02.061</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025512001892</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service-oriented architecture has offered an opportunity to quickly and independently develop new business applications from the existing services. Given that many services are available with the same function but different quality of service (QoS) properties, and service users have different QoS preferences, the challenge of service composition is to select appropriate service candidates to maximize the overall utility while satisfying a user’s requirements. In this paper, we propose a decomposition-based approach for service composition, in which the utility of a composite service can be computed from the utilities of component services and the constraints of component services can be derived from the constraints of the composite service. Thus, with our approach, it is possible to independently manage the selection of each component service, leading to more scalability and more flexibility for service composition in a dynamic environment. The experiment studies show that our approach can achieve a near-optimal solution with a significantly improved performance in computation time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sun, Yi</author><author>He, Shaoyi</author><author>Leu, Jack Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Syndicating Web Services: A QoS and user-driven approach</title><secondary-title>Decision Support Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Decision Support Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>243-255</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>ahp method</keyword><keyword>brown</keyword><keyword>gibson method</keyword><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword><keyword>web services registry</keyword><keyword>web services syndication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dss.2006.09.011</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167923606001357</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web Services that provide a real-time e-business solution via online binding of software components must have a mechanism to win users' confidence in the quality of service (QoS) to establish a solid foot holding in the market.

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Brown–Gibson (BG) methods were adapted to facilitate quality assessment. An optimization model was proposed for Web Service syndication.

Therefore, testing semantic web services is becoming a key concern as an essential quality assurance measure. The objective of this systematic literature review is to summarize the current state of the art of functional testing of semantic web services by providing answers to a set of research questions. The review follows a predefined procedure that involves automatically searching 5 well-known digital libraries. After applying the selection criteria to the results, a total of 34 studies were identified as relevant. Required information was extracted from the studies and summarized. Our systematic literature review identified some approaches available for deriving test cases from the specifications of semantic web services. However, many of the approaches are either not validated or the validation done lacks credibility. We believe that a substantial amount of work remains to be done to improve the current state of research in the area of testing semantic web services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Talantikite, Hassina Nacer</author><author>Aissani, Djamil</author><author>Boudjlida, Nacer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Semantic annotations for web services discovery and composition</title><secondary-title>Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Standards &amp; Interfaces</full-title></periodical><pages>1108-1117</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>semantic annotations</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.csi.2008.09.041</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0920548908001591</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The automatic discovery and composition of Web services rely on the facilities offered by the providers of services in describing the functionalities of their services semantically and on the description of the client's requests and their needs, without being ambiguous.

Then the system generates a new composite resource service (CRS) and selects the optimal resource service composite path from all possible paths to execute the task with the given multi-objective (e.g., time minimization, cost minimization and reliability maximization) and multi-constraints. The above problem is defined as multi-objective MGrid resource service composition and optimal-selection (MO-MRSCOS) problem. The formulation is presented for an MO-MRSCOS problem. The correlations among resource services are taken into account during MGrid resource service composition, and a QoS description mode supporting resource service correlation is presented. The basic resource service composite modes (RSCM) for CRS are described, and the principles for translating a complicated RSCM into a simple sequence RSCM are presented for simplifying the resolving process and complexity of MO-MRSCOS problem. A new method based on the principles of particle swarm optimization (PSO), is proposed for solving MO-MRSCOS problem. Unlike previous works: (a) the proposed PSO algorithms combine the non-dominated sorting technique to achieve the selection of global best position and private best position; (b) the parameters of particle updating formulation in PSO are dynamical generated in order to make a compromise between the global exploration and local exploitation abilities of PSO; (c) permutation-based and objective-based population trimming operators are applied in PSO to maintain diversity of solutions in population. The experimental results and performance comparison show that the proposed method is both effective and efficient.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tao, Qian</author><author>Chang, Hui-you</author><author>Gu, Chun-qin</author><author>Yi, Yang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel prediction approach for trustworthy QoS of web services</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>3676-3681</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.060</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417411013698</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web service is a new type of component that can be invoked over the internet, and complex network applications can be described as processes invoking web services selected at runtime. The more services are available, the more difficult it becomes to find the most appropriate service for a specific application. As a nonfunctional requirement, quality of service (QoS) plays an important role in the selection of web services. However, the complex network environment and illegal operations generally influence the trustworthiness of web services QoS.

The system’s Web-aspect provides significant advantages, as the system is distributed through interoperable, cross-platform and highly pluggable Web-service components. The system involves a powerful workflow engine that manages the entire process event flow within the enterprise increasing efficiency and control at the same time. Business processes, when needed, are controlled by the enterprise quality management system and consequently the ISO directives are accurately followed. A real-world process scheduling system developed for the specific needs of Greek Construction Manufacturing Enterprises is illustrated as a detailed paradigm of the system’s capabilities. The problem was formulated to assign project tasks in form of lots to enterprise resources in order that resources idle time and delays in project preparation time were minimized.

Runtime management has been given utmost significance as a potential strategy to handle runtime exceptions increases the adaptability of services to exceptional circumstances. service computing aims for efficiently handling run time issues during service computation such as exception handling, change management and dynamic reconfigurable services. There are many exceptions often raised during service consumption and execution at run time and some of them gets resolved, but many of them failed to resolve due to the lack of run time exception handling mechanism. In this paper we propose a model for context aware web service exception handling targeting service life time and service reaction time which could determine whether the exception is solvable or un solvable with respect to the exception context with time and policy constraints. Thus a novel approach for web service runtime exception handling has been proposed which affords facilities for managing the runtime exception with the help of a set of QoS parameters that are satisfying the service computational criteria such as computability, traceability, and decidability. In addition to that, it supports serviceability, manageability, availability and configurability. The results encourage new direction of research with performance upgrade in the field of service computing for runtime exception handling.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tong, Endong</author><author>Niu, Wenjia</author><author>Li, Gang</author><author>Tang, Ding</author><author>Chang, Liang</author><author>Shi, Zhongzhi</author><author>Ci, Song</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bloom filter-based workflow management to enable QoS guarantee in wireless sensor networks</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>38-51</pages><volume>39</volume><keywords><keyword>hierarchical work fl ow</keyword><keyword>management</keyword><keyword>wireless sensor network</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2013.04.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804513001057</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As a popular service composition technology, workflow has been successfully used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to compose a set of atomic services for service-oriented WSN applications. However, in a resource-constrained WSN, the sensed data is usually inaccurate or even missing, and this affects the normal execution of atomic services and may result in the non-guaranteed workflow QoS. Because the implementation of workflows in WSNs is usually hierarchical, effective workflow management in a WSN should consider both aspects of atomic services and sensor nodes, though this has largely been overlooked in existing research. Hence, a dynamic QoS-oriented, effective and efficient hierarchical workflow management mechanism is necessary. In this paper, we propose a Bloom filter-based hierarchical workflow management model, which coordinates both the atomic service level and the node level for guaranteed workflow QoS. Through constructing the service-level counting Bloom filter (CBF) to maintain the set of normal atomic services, and constructing the node-level Bloom filter (BF) to maintain the set of attribute strings of the current working nodes, an effective and efficient QoS degradation locating can be realized. Furthermore, the corresponding adaptation mechanism for guaranteed QoS is also developed. The case study and experimental evaluations demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in WSNs.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tosic, Vladimir</author><author>Pagurek, Bernard</author><author>Patel, Kruti</author><author>Esfandiari, Babak</author><author>Ma, Wei</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Management applications of the Web Service Offerings Language (WSOL)</title><secondary-title>Information Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>564-586</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.is.2004.11.005</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45017-3_32</url><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306437904001012</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We discuss possible Web Service Management (WSM) and Web Service Composition Management (WSCM) applications of the Web Service Offerings Language (WSOL) and how the language supports these applications. WSOL is a novel language for the formal specification of classes of service, various constraints (functional constraints, Quality of Service — QoS, and access rights), and management statements (subscription and pay-per-use prices, monetary penalties, and management responsibilities) for Web Services. Describing a Web Service in WSOL, in addition to the Web Services Description Language (WSDL), enables monitoring, metering, and management of Web Services. Metering of QoS metrics and evaluation of constraints can be the responsibility of the provider Web Service, the consumer, and/or one or more mutually trusted third parties (SOAP intermediaries or probes). Further, manipulation of classes of service (switching, deactivation/reactivation, and dynamic creation) can be used for dynamic (i.e., run-time) adaptation and management of Web Service compositions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tran, Vuong Xuan</author><author>Tsuji, Hidekazu</author><author>Masuda, Ryosuke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new QoS ontology and its QoS-based ranking algorithm for Web services</title><secondary-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>1378-1398</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.simpat.2009.06.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1569190X09000859</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web service composition is a promising solution for building distributed applications on the Internet in which Web service discovery is a key step. With a number of Web services having similar functionality, it is necessary to rank those services to select the best Web services for a request. QoS information which can reflect user’s expectation and experience of using a service is often used as a distinguish factor in a service ranking algorithm. Different service providers and participants may use different QoS concepts for describing service quality information. Therefore, it leads to the issue of semantic interoperability of QoS. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for designing and developing a QoS ontology and its QoS-based ranking algorithm for evaluating Web services. The QoS ontology can support not only describing QoS information in great detail but also facilitating various service participants expressing their QoS offers and demands at different levels of expectation. The QoS-based ranking algorithm adopted Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a multiple criteria decision making technique, as an underlying mechanism for developing a flexible and dynamic ranking algorithm. The proposed QoS ontology and ranking algorithm can be used in various applications in order to facilitate automatic and dynamic discovery and selection of Web services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trnkoczy, Jernej</author><author>Stankovski, Vlado</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Improving the performance of Federated Digital Library services</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>824-832</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2008.04.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X08000538</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The number of Digital Libraries (DLs) accessible over the Open Archives Initiative–Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI–PMH) has been constantly increasing in the past years. Earlier efforts in the DL area have concentrated on metadata harvesting and provisioning of value-added Federated Digital Library (FDL) services to the users. FDL services, however, have to meet significant performance and scalability requirements, which is difficult to achieve in centralized metadata harvesting systems. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the benefits of using Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) compliant grid middleware infrastructure for providing efficient and reliable FDL services. The presented FDL application allows for parallel harvesting of OAI–PMH compliant DLs. The results show that this approach efficiently solves the performance related problems, while it also contributes to greater flexibility of the system. The quality of service is improved as metadata can be updated frequently, and the system does not exhibit a single point of failure.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tsai, M</author><author>Wang, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A computing coordination based fuzzy group decision-making (CC-FGDM) for web service oriented architecture</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>2921-2936</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>business process execution language</keyword><keyword>fuzzy decision-making</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2007.05.017</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S095741740700187X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As the demands for faster data processing and enterprise computing are increasing, the traditional client/server architecture has gradually been replaced by Grid computing or the peer-to-peer (P2P) model which can share the content or resources over the network.

This is mainly due to the fact that a large amount of geospatial content is usually distributed, non-compliant to standards, and needs to be transmitted under a QoS guaranteed framework to support effective decision making either in case of an emergency or in advance planning. Incorporating real time capabilities in Web services, both in terms of dynamic configuration and service selection, is an open research agenda. The things get worst in geospatial context due to the huge amount of data transmitted from distributed sensors under heterogeneous platforms, making the need of synchronization an important issue. In this paper, we propose a flexible service oriented architecture for planning and decision support in environmental crisis management. The suggested architecture uses real time geospatial data sets and 3D presentation tools, integrated with added-value services, such as simulation models for assisting decision making in case of emergency. The proposed architectural framework goes beyond integration and presentation of static spatial data, to include real time middleware that is responsible for selecting the most appropriate method of the available geospatial content and service in order to satisfy the QoS requirements of users and/or application. A case study of a complete, real world implementation of the suggested framework dealing with forest fire crisis management system is also presented.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Ping</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>QoS-aware web services selection with intuitionistic fuzzy set under consumer’s vague perception</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>4460-4466</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2008.05.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417408002339</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Appropriate application of service selection based on QoS-aware can bring great benefits to service consumers, as it is able to reduce redundancy in search. It also generates advantages for service providers who deliver valuable services. However, non-functional QoS attributes are not easy to measure due to their complexity and the involvement of consumer’s fuzzy perceptions of QoS. In this paper, a new decision model under vague information is proposed. It extends Max–Min–Max composition of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS) for selection of web services. Furthermore, an improved fuzzy ranking index is proposed to alleviate the bias of existing approaches. The index aggregates both concord and discord degrees of the decision maker’s satisfaction in order to analyze the synthetic satisfaction degree for web services. In addition, an example of QoS-aware web services selection is illustrated to demonstrate the proposed approach. Finally, the proposed method is verified by a sensitivity analysis.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Ping</author><author>Chao, Kuo-Ming</author><author>Lo, Chi-Chun</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On optimal decision for QoS-aware composite service selection</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>440-449</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.070</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417409004898</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The increasing popularity of employing web services for distributed systems contributes to the significance of service discovery. However, duplicated and similar functional features existing among services require service consumers to include additional aspects to evaluate the services. Generally, the service consumers would have different view on the quality of service (QoS) of service attributes. How to select the best composite service in theory among available service (WS) candidates for consumers is an interesting practical issue. This work proposes a QoS-aware service selection model based on fuzzy linear programming (FLP) technologies, in order to identify their dissimilarity on service alternatives, assist service consumers in selecting most suitable services with consideration of their expectations and preferences. This approach can obtain the optimal solution of consensual weight of QoS attribute and fuzzy positive ideal solution (FPIS) by extending LINMAP method, developed by Srinivasan and Shocker. Finally, two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the process of QoS-aware web service selection. The experimental results demonstrated that it is a feasible and supplementary manner in selecting the of web services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wasmer, Anna</author><author>Staub, Günter</author><author>Vroom, Regine W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An industry approach to shared, cross-organisational engineering change handling - The road towards standards for product data processing</title><secondary-title>Computer-Aided Design</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer-Aided Design</full-title></periodical><pages>533-545</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>engineering change management</keyword><keyword>engineering change process automation</keyword><keyword>product data technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cad.2010.10.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S001044851000196X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Standards for cross-enterprise communication between systems that actively manage product data and which control the associated workflows–including release and approval processes–have been in industrial use for some time. Experiences gained during the last decade showed that purely data centric approaches, such as supported by IGES, ISO 10303 (STEP) and IFC are not sufficient. Cross-enterprise communication requires not only agreements about data format and semantics, but also about orderly procedures for efficient communication between the stakeholders in a workflow. This paper presents the background and approach taken for the development of a standard for cross-company engineering change management (ECM), which is currently undertaken as a joint activity between VDA (German Association of the Automotive Industry) and ProSTEP iViP (international association for information integration in industry). Based on the results of this joint activity, which was recently published as SASIG ECM Recommendation V2.0 and as VDA 4965 V3.0, ECM Pilot implementations within member companies were conducted. They proved that a lead-time reduction of the engineering change process of 20%–40% is possible while the quality of the process increases. The approach itself should work not only in engineering change or product data environments, but also in document oriented environments as well as in sectors other than automotive. The ECM standard provides specifications of reference business processes, including the definition of the participants’ roles and the interaction and synchronization (“touch”) points where data are communicated. It leverages and builds on other established product data standards wherever possible. Thus, the data model defined by STEP AP214, (Core Data for automotive mechanical design processes) is used to describe the “payload”–i.e. the product data content to be exchanged–at defined synchronization points. OMG’s PLM Services provide the framework for sending messages between the stakeholders of an Engineering Change, and business process modelling languages such as e.g. BPEL (Business Process Execution Language), standardized by OASIS, provide the capability to execute the ECM protocol’s specification. They ensure the ability to use the latest state-of-the-art internet technologies such as XML and web-services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Guoquan</author><author>Wei, Jun</author><author>Ye, Chunyang</author><author>Zhong, Hua</author><author>Huang, Tao</author><author>He, Hong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Journal of Systems and Software Specification and monitoring of data-centric temporal properties for service-based systems</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Systems &amp; Software</full-title></periodical><pages>2738-2754</pages><volume>85</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2012.05.075</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2012.05.075</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service-based systems operate in a very dynamic environment. To guarantee functional and non-functional objective at runtime, an adaptation mechanism is usually expected to monitor software changes, make appropriate decisions, and act accordingly. However, existing runtime monitoring solutions consider only the constraints on the sequence of messages exchanged between partner services and ignore the actual data contents inside the messages. As a result, it is difficult to monitor some dynamic properties such as how message data of interest is processed between different participants. To address this issue, we propose an efficient, non-intrusive online monitoring approach to dynamically analyze data-centric properties for service-oriented applications involving multiple participants. By introducing Par-BCL – a Parametric Behavior Constraint Language for Web services – to define monitoring parameters, various data-centric temporal behavior properties for Web services can be specified and monitored. This approach broadens the monitored patterns to include not only message exchange orders, but also data contents bound to the parameters. To reduce runtime overhead, we statically analyze the monitored properties and combine two different indexing mechanisms to optimize monitoring. The experiments show that our solution is efficient and promising.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Quanwang</author><author>Zhu, Qingsheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transactional and QoS-aware dynamic service composition based on ant colony optimization</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>1112-1119</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2012.12.010</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X12002300</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Service composition facilitates seamless and flexible integration of applications from different providers. With the growing number of services that offer the same functionality but differ in non-functional properties published online, an efficient approach for dynamic service selection and composition is required. Traditionally, the problem is mostly addressed either from the quality of service (QoS) aspect or from the transaction aspect. In this paper, we first investigate the transactional properties of services and focus on how to compose individual services in a transactional manner, and then formulate the problem of transactional and QoS-aware dynamic service composition. By modeling the problem as a constrained directed acyclic graph, the ant colony optimization algorithm is utilized to seek a near-to-optimal solution efficiently. At last empirical studies are conducted and the experiments show that the proposed approach can approximate the optimal solution well while staying efficient.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, Quanwang</author><author>Zhu, Qingsheng</author><author>Jian, Xing</author><author>Ishikawa, Fuyuki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Broker-based SLA-aware composite service provisioning</title><secondary-title>Journal of Systems and Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Systems and Software</full-title></periodical><pages>194-201</pages><volume>96</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.027</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0164121214001459</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>QoS-aware service composition aims to satisfy users’ quality of services (QoS) needs during service composition. Traditional methods simply attempt to maximize user satisfaction by provisioning the composite service instance with the best QoS. These “best-effort” methods fail to take into account that there also exist other consumers competing for the service resources and their decisions of service selection/composition can impact on QoS. Since user's QoS needs can be met once the demanded level is reached, in this paper, we propose an “on-demand” strategy for QoS-aware service composition to replace the traditional “best-effort” strategy. The service broker is introduced to facilitate implementation of this strategy: it first purchases a number of service instances for each component from providers and then provisions the composite services with different QoS classes to consumers. This paper focuses on how the broker follows the service level agreement (SLA) to provision composite services in the “on-demand” manner. This problem is formally expressed as the minimization of the QoS distance function between SLA and QoS of composite service instances, under a series of constraints. Heuristic approaches are proposed for the problem and experiments are conducted at last to verify their effectiveness and efficiency.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Xu, Ruzhi</author><author>Ji, Baitao</author><author>Zhang, Bin</author><author>Nie, Peiyao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Research on dynamic business composition based on web service proxies</title><secondary-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory</full-title></periodical><pages>43-55</pages><volume>37</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2013</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><isbn>5318261787</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.simpat.2013.05.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1569190X13000877</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services-based business composition brings a number of advantages to the enterprise application development.

The framework is featured with a QoS model, an effective service discovery and selection algorithms to facilitate the dynamic integration of Web services and management of abnormalities. Furthermore, a business process constructing method based on service slice is put forward to satisfy the users’ personalized requirements more effectively and flexibly. Our study concerns both functionality and QoS characteristics of Web services to identify the optimal business process solutions. A Complete case study is also included in this paper and the performance demonstrated that the framework and algorithms can provide a tangible and reliable solution to dynamic Web service composition and adaptation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yahyaoui, H</author><author>Wang, L</author><author>Mourad, A</author><author>Almullah, M</author><author>Sheng, Q.Z.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards context-adaptable Web service policies</title><secondary-title>Procedia Computer Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Procedia Computer Science</full-title></periodical><pages>610-617</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>aspect-oriented programming</keyword><keyword>context</keyword><keyword>policies</keyword><keyword>web service policy language</keyword><keyword>web services</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.procs.2011.07.079</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1877050911004042</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We propose in this paper a new approach to achieve highly adaptable Web services through context-adaptable Web service policies. A Web service policy is a set of rules that defines the capabilities and requirements of a Web service as well as governs the runtime behavior, quality and result of the Web service. Our Web service policies are superbly adaptable in the sense that we specify context for both policies and rules to make the policies contextadaptable at both policy and rule levels. The main contributions of our approach include: i) an innovative WSPL (Web Service Policy Language) extension to allow context specification at both policy and rule levels; and ii) a tool that supports the development of aspect oriented policies, including an option to translate WSPL policies into aspect oriented policies. These policies can then be statically woven into compositeWeb services (e.g. a BPEL process). The synergy between context, policies and aspects allows to increase the level of adaptability of Web services at different levels of applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yahyaoui, Hamdi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A trust-based game theoretical model for Web services collaboration</title><secondary-title>Knowledge-Based Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Knowledge-Based Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>162-169</pages><volume>27</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.knosys.2011.10.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0950705111002346</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We present in this paper a trust-based game theoretical model for Web services collaboration. Each collaboration is modeled as a game. In each round of the game, a collaborating Web service submits a cost for achieving a specific task. The task-owner Web service computes the so-called trust-based cost, which is the product between the submitted cost and the inverse of the trust value of the bidding Web service. The game winner is the Web service which has the minimal trust-based cost. The trust is derived from the quality attribute values of a Web service. These values are computed during a collaboration evaluation period. They are updated after each game round based on a demotion or promotion decision. We also show how the proposed model is convenient for modeling Web services composition and assessing the trust of composite Web services. Furthermore, we provide a metric for the assessment of the collaboration trust. The application of this metric shows that the use of the trust allows a safer collaboration with respect to a game where there is no consideration of the trust as a criteria for allocating tasks.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yahyaoui, Hamdi</author><author>Almulla, Mohamed</author><author>Own, Hala S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A novel non-functional matchmaking approach between fuzzy user queries and real world web services based on rough sets</title><secondary-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Future Generation Computer Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>27-38</pages><volume>35</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.future.2013.12.033</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167739X13002975</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We propose in this paper a novel matchmaking approach between fuzzy user queries and real world Web services.

A critical issue in this area is for service consumers and service providers to effectively achieve agreements on non-functional aspects of service provision, such as quality of service. However, this issue has not been well addressed, especially in the context of service composition provision which implies the establishment of a set of interrelated agreements on quality of service between the service consumer and multiple service providers offering various services in the composition. There is a lack of supporting frameworks and techniques to automatically and dynamically achieve agreements on quality of service constraints for individual services in a service composition, aiming at fulfilling composition’s end-to-end quality of service requirements. This paper reports the authors’ recent research in addressing this issue, using the agent technology. In this research, the service level agreements for a service composition are established through autonomous agent negotiation. To enable this, an innovative framework is proposed in which the service consumer is represented by a set of agents who negotiate quality of service constraints with the service providers for various services in the composition. This negotiation is well coordinated in order to achieve end-to-end quality of service requirements. Based on this framework, a new negotiation protocol is presented to support coordinated negotiation. A utility-function-based decision-making model is proposed based on which agents can proactively decide on the course of further actions. Moreover, this paper also contributes the novel design of the negotiation Web service on the service providers’ side for the purpose of interoperability. Finally, the prototype implementation for the purpose of proof-of-concept is discussed.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ye, Nong</author><author>Gel, Esma S</author><author>Li, Xueping</author><author>Farley, Toni</author><author>Lai, Ying-cheng</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Web server QoS models: applying scheduling rules from production planning</title><secondary-title>Computers &amp; Operations Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computers &amp; Operations Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1147-1164</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>qos</keyword><keyword>quality of service</keyword><keyword>scheduling rules</keyword><keyword>simulation model</keyword><keyword>web server</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cor.2003.10.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0305054803003149</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Most web servers, in practical use, use a queuing policy based on the Best Effort model, which employs the first-in-first-out (FIFO) scheduling rule to prioritize web requests in a single queue. This model does not provide Quality of Service (QoS). In the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) model, separate queues are introduced to differentiate QoS for separate web requests with different priorities. This paper presents web server QoS models that use a single queue, along with scheduling rules from production planning in the manufacturing domain, to differentiate QoS for classes of web service requests with different priorities. These scheduling rules are Weighted Shortest Processing Time (WSPT), Apparent Tardiness Cost (ATC), and Earliest Due Date. We conduct simulation experiments and compare the QoS performance of these scheduling rules with the FIFO scheme used in the basic Best Effort model with only one queue, and the basic DiffServ model with two separate queues. Simulation results demonstrate better QoS performance using WSPT and ATC, especially when requested services exceed the capacity of a web server.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yin, Jianwei</author><author>Lo, Wei</author><author>Deng, Shuiguang</author><author>Li, Ying</author><author>Wu, Zhaohui</author><author>Xiong, Naixue</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Colbar: A collaborative location-based regularization framework for QoS prediction</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>68-84</pages><volume>265</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2013.12.007</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0020025513008517</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Quality-of-Service (QoS) is a fundamental element in Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) domain. At the ongoing age of Web 2.0, predicting the missing QoS values becomes more and more important since it is an indispensable preprocess of numerous service-oriented applications. Previous research works on this task underestimate the importance of users’ geographical information, which we argue would contribute to improving prediction accuracy in Web services invocation process. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative location-based regularization framework (Colbar) to address the problem of personalized QoS prediction. We first leverage the personal geographical and QoS information to identify robust neighborhoods. And then, we collect the wisdom of crowds to construct two location-based regularization terms, which are integrated to build up an unified Matrix Factorization framework. Finally we make intermediate fusions to generate better prediction results. The experimental analysis on a large-scale real-world QoS dataset shows that the prediction accuracy of Colbar outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches in various criteria.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yoo, Taejong</author><author>Jeong, Buhwan</author><author>Cho, Hyunbo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Petri Nets based functional validation for services composition</title><secondary-title>Expert Systems with Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert Systems with Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>3768-3776</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2010</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier Ltd</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.046</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0957417409009889</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The service-oriented architecture (SOA) has been quite prevailing in enterprise applications development, integration, and deployment. In SOA environment, the complex problem can be solved by combining available individual services and ordering them to best suit their problem requirements. Service composition accelerates rapid enterprise application development, service reuse, and complex service consummation. Along with its dissemination, a potential – inevitable but must-be-overcome – problem is lack of interoperability among services as well as poor integrity and quality of individual ones. There are many existing approaches to compose service composition, ranging from abstract methods to those aiming to be industry standards (e.g. BPEL, BPSS, WSFL, etc.). However, they have been biased to define the SOA technology to create service composition. Explicitly, few approaches have concerned to the service composition at design time. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a systematic approach to assure integrity and interoperability in service composition at design time. In this paper, we utilize a functional validation to check the seamless connectivity between individual services to be composed and to represent services’ interdependency (e.g., invocation precedence) in a Petri Nets with reachability analysis and each service’s semantic description (e.g., functionality and role, input/output data definition, QoS metrics and values). This approach can be further used as a service composition validation methodology and an input to quality assessment, either as is or with augmentation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Chengwen</author><author>Su, Sen</author><author>Chen, Junliang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DiGA: Population diversity handling genetic algorithm for QoS-aware web services selection</title><secondary-title>Computer Communications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Computer Communications</full-title></periodical><pages>1082-1090</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>diversity handling</keyword><keyword>genetic algorithm</keyword><keyword>qos-aware</keyword><keyword>relation matrix coding scheme</keyword><keyword>simulated annealing</keyword><keyword>web services selection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.comcom.2006.11.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140366406004282</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A special genetic algorithm is presented for web services selection with global QoS constraints. The relation matrix coding scheme of genome is its basis. In this genetic algorithm, a new evolution function of population is presented. Furthermore, an especial population selection policy is proposed based on the combination of population diversity handling and simulated annealing. The policy accords with the evolution characteristic of population diversity much more. It enhances convergence of genetic algorithm and can get more excellent composite service plan. The simulation results on web services selection with global QoS constraints have shown that the prematurity was overcome effectively, and that the convergence of genetic algorithm was improved very well.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, Zhongju</author><author>Tan, Yong</author><author>Dey, Debabrata</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Price competition with service level guarantee in web services</title><secondary-title>Decision Support Systems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Decision Support Systems</full-title></periodical><pages>93-104</pages><volume>47</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dss.2009.01.004</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S016792360900027X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Web services have become quite popular over the last few years as they allow easier development and integration of business applications. Unlike traditional software systems, web services are self-contained modular software components that are delivered over a network (such as the Internet) and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services. However, the network and processing overhead associated with web services have also presented a significant challenge to its performance. As a result, a web service provider often announces a service-level agreement when launching a service. The service-level agreement provides a guarantee to the consumers that they can get the service they pay for at an assured level of quality. In this paper, we study the competition between two such providers offering functionally the same web services. Each provider needs to decide a service level (standard or premium) she would offer and a corresponding price for the selected service level to meet the QoS guarantee (in terms of an average response time of the service). We first analyze the case where the providers choose service levels and prices simultaneously, and then extend it to a sequential-move situation. Finally, we examine strategic choices of providers when the processing capacity is endogenized into the model.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Laiping</author><author>Ren, Yizhi</author><author>Li, Mingchu</author><author>Sakurai, Kouichi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flexible service selection with user-specific QoS support in service-oriented architecture</title><secondary-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Network and Computer Applications</full-title></periodical><pages>962-973</pages><volume>35</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Quality of service</keyword><keyword>Scheduling</keyword><keyword>Service-oriented architecture</keyword><keyword>Web service</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jnca.2011.03.013</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1084804511000671</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Along with the development of the service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud computing, a large number of service providers have created an intense competitive world of business. Consequently, it is becoming increasingly complex to select a service provider for a user as a result of their various economic and social attributes. In this paper, we state the problem of how to find the appropriate services with satisfying the users' multiple QoS requirements. We consider the service's response time, trust degree and monetary cost. And inspired from the mode of Web search engine, such as Yahoo, Google, we propose an innovative service selection algorithm for SOA systems. The algorithm can recommend a number of suitable services based on the user's QoS requirements. Compared with the existing scheduling algorithms, our solution is much more flexible in supporting the multiple objectives and user personalization. We study the scalability of the algorithm with different numbers of jobs, service providers and QoS criteria. And we find that it can capture user's preferences value in less than six times of job submissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Science Direct.enl" path="Science Direct.enl">Science Direct.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhao, Xinchao</author><author>Song, Boqian</author><author>Huang, Panyu</author><author>Wen, Zichao</author><author>Weng, Jialei</author><author>Fan, Yi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An improved discrete immune optimization algorithm based on PSO for QoS-driven web service composition</title><secondary-title>Applied Soft Computing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Soft Computing</full-title></periodical><pages>2208-2216</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2012</year></dates><publisher>Elsevier B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.asoc.2012.03.040</electronic-resource-num><urls><pdf-urls><url>internal-pdf://</url></pdf-urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S156849461200138X</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>An improved discrete immune optimization algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (IDIPSO) is proposed for Quality of Service (QoS)-driven web service composition with global QoS constraints.
