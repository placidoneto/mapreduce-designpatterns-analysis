Unwanted power consumption was always a matter of concern from last 2 years for the administrators of datacenters. Therefore, a research trial in order to minimize the power consumption has become of the prominent concern in the area of cloud computing as it claims zero down-time as per Service Level Agreement. In this research work, we consider the case of multimedia video sharing web services, which we believe is frequently in top of the hit counter with millions of user sharing high size of video application, giving rise of power consumption from data center. The proposed system presents a unique provisioning technique which amalgamates the power factor with network resources. The simulation results also show that the system is successful in maintaining an equilibrium between power utilization at data center along with unit of task allocation processing.;;2012;A, Arunadevi.

From a provider perspective, Cloud Computing enables companies to significantly increase their hardware utilization rate and allows external customers to use the company's infrastructure on pay-per-use revenue models. From a client perspective, it enables the on-demand allocation of sufficient resources to solve complex computational problems or to scale all kinds of applications. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been under constant change in recent years. Emerging web service technologies stimulated the evolution from desktop- and data-centric GIS to distributed and loosely coupled web services merged into the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) concept. The processing of data is an essential part of daily work of GIS experts. With increasing amount of available data and higher requirements on adopted algorithms, the data processing part in SDIs becomes crucial in terms of practicability and performance. Cloud Computing offers a technical opportunity for the on-demand provisioning of sufficient resources for computing-intensive algorithms and an economic opportunity to support future business models. This paper presents an OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) implementation that uses Cloud Computing resources to perform geoprocessing tasks. The resource usage is monitored and the accumulated usage costs are charged to the service consumer account. The implementation will be demonstrated in a real world use case that is based on governmental forest management.";;;"A, B. Baranski; A, T. Deelmann & B, B.

To serve their customers, SaaS providers utilize resources of internal data centers or rent resources from a public Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. In-house hosting can increase administration and maintenance costs whereas renting from an IaaS provider can impact the service quality due to its variable performance. To overcome these limitations, innovative admission control and scheduling algorithms for SaaS providers to effectively utilize public Cloud resources to maximize profit by minimizing cost and improving customer satisfaction level are required. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive evaluation study to analyze which solution suits best in which scenario to maximize SaaS provider’s profit.;;2013;"A, R. S. Mohana; B, Dr. P. Thangaraj & C, S.

DAHM is complementary to dynamic workload distribution problem and is modeled as mixed integer programming; online algorithms are developed to solve the problem. The algorithms are evaluated in a simulation study using realistic data and compared with performance-oriented application assignment, i.e., hosting the application at a data center whose delay is the least. Our simulations results indicate that DAHM can potentially save up to 20\% cost while incurring only a nominal increase in SLA violations. The savings are obtained by exploiting the cost efficiency variation as well as reducing the total number of VMs employed to host applications.";?;2011;"Abbasi, Zahra; Mukherjee, Tridib; Varsamopoulos, Georgios; Gupta, Sandeep K.

Cloud computing has emerged as one of the enabling technologies that allow such external hosting efficiently. Like any IT environment, a Cloud Computing environment requires high level of maintenance to be able to provide services to its customers. Replacing defective items (hardware/software), applying security patches, or upgrading firmware are just a few examples of the typical maintenance procedures needed in such environments. While taking resources down for maintenance, applying efficient change management techniques is a key factor to the success of the cloud. As energy has become a precious resource, research has been conducted towards devising protocols that minimize energy consumption in IT systems. In this paper, we propose a pro-active energy efficient technique for change management in cloud computing environments. We formulate the management problem into an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the cloud. Our proposed approach is pro-active in the sense that it takes prior SLA (Service Level Agreement) requests into account while determining time slots in which changes should take place.;;2009;"Abdelsalam, Hady; Maly, Kurt; Mukkamala, Ravi; Zubair, Mohammad & Kaminsky, David";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1574663.1574681;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;6;Analysis of Energy Efficiency in Clouds;A cloud can be defined as a pool of computer resources that can host a variety of different workloads, ranging from long-running scientific jobs (e.g., modeling and simulation) to transactional work (e.g., web applications). A cloud computing platform dynamically provisions, configures, reconfigures, and de-provisions servers as needed. Servers in the cloud can be physical machines or virtual machines. Cloud-hosting facilities, including many large businesses that run clouds in-house, became more common as businesses tend to out-source their computing needs more and more. For large-scale clouds power consumption is a major cost factor. Modern computing devices have the ability to run at various frequencies each one with a different power consumption level. Hence, the possibility exists to choose frequencies at which applications run to optimize total power consumption while staying within the constraints of the Service Level Agreements (SLA) that govern the applications. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical relationship of these SLAs and the number of servers that should be used and at what frequencies they should be running. We discuss a proactive provisioning model that includes hardware failures, devices available for services, and devices available for change management, all as a function of time and within constraints of SLAs. We provide scenarios that illustrate the mathematical relationships for a sample cloud and that provides a range of possible power consumption savings for different environments.;;2009;"Abdelsalam, Hady S.; Maly, Kurt; Mukkamala, Ravi; Zubair, Mohammad & Kaminsky, David";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1673078.1674366 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5359623;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;7;Towards integrating information of service level agreement and resources as a services (RaaS) for cloud computing environment;Cloud computing describes services and applications that are extended to be accessible through the Internet. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contractual agreement that has been established between the members of Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that consists of the service provider and its recipient for a specific application of services based on its allocating and sharing Resources as a Service (RaaS). In this context, there are many parties who are very concerning about it, but unfortunately there is lack of a common mapping of SLA information and RaaS of best practice as a guideline that can be used by CSP in making decision for the future purposes in engaging with services in the cloud computing environment. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to integrate information of SLA and RaaS in order to ensure everybody who are providing and receiving the services in the cloud particularly will be satisfied and getting the best maximum Return Of the Investment (ROI) in allocating and sharing resources among the providers and recipients in cloud computing environment. As a result, some attributes such as reliability, readability and standardization of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are found to be high.;;2012;Abdullah, Rusli & Talib, Amir Mohamed;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6417613;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;8;Bidding Strategies in QoS-Aware Cloud Systems Based on N-Armed Bandit Problems;In this paper we consider a set of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, that offer a set of Web services using the Cloud facilities provided by an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. We assume that the IaaS provider offers a pay only what you use scheme similar to the Amazon EC2 service, comprising flat, on demand, and spot virtual machine instances. We propose a two-stage provisioning scheme. In the first stage, the SaaS providers determine the number of required flat and on demand instances by means of standard optimization techniques. In the second stage, the SaaS providers compete by bidding for the spot instances which are instantiated using the unused IaaS capacity. We put our focus on the bidding decision process by the SaaS providers, which takes place during the second stage, and apply N-armed bandit problems, in which the player is faced repeatedly with a choice among N different options, and every time he submits his decision evaluating past feedbacks. Through numerical experiments, we analyze proposed strategies under different scenarios and prove the SaaS providers ability to refine their behavior round by round and to determine the best bid so to maximize their revenue and achieve as many spot resources as possible, also addressing the importance of a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, i.e., among greedy and non-greedy actions.;;2014;"Abundo, Marco; Di Valerio, Valerio; Cardellini, Valeria & Presti, Francesco Lo";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6786761 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2607055.2607497;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;9;Cloud monitoring: A survey;Nowadays, Cloud Computing is widely used to deliver services over the Internet for both technical and economical reasons. The number of Cloud-based services has increased rapidly and strongly in the last years, and so is increased the complexity of the infrastructures behind these services. To properly operate and manage such complex infrastructures effective and efficient monitoring is constantly needed. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud properties, features, underlying technologies (e.g. virtualization), security and privacy. However, to the best of our knowledge, these surveys lack a detailed analysis of monitoring for the Cloud. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a survey on Cloud monitoring. We start analyzing motivations for Cloud monitoring, providing also definitions and background for the following contributions. Then, we carefully analyze and discuss the properties of a monitoring system for the Cloud, the issues arising from such properties and how such issues have been tackled in literature. We also describe current platforms, both commercial and open source, and services for Cloud monitoring, underlining how they relate with the properties and issues identified before. Finally, we identify open issues, main challenges and future directions in the field of Cloud monitoring.1Preliminary results within the same framework have been published in G. Aceto, A.

The resources in a cloud are virtualized as a collection of services using the virtualization technology. Efficient provisioning of resources is a lofty problem due to the lively nature and the need to support heterogeneous applications with diverse performance requirements. The performance guarantee from the cloud datacenter requires efficient utilization of the resources. The efficient resource utilization towards any specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) or constraint on Quality of Service (QoS) alone is not sufficient for the cloud computing environments. Thus, cloud computing requires to strike a balance between the performance based on the negotiated QoS as well as the energy consumption at the datacenter during the process of resource provisioning. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of cloud computing architectures and provisioning mechanisms for delivering the computing as a service. We classify the cloud computing architectures discussed in literature based on their significance in cloud services provisioning mechanism. The paper presents taxonomy of dynamic provisioning mechanisms from the cloud utility point of view and brings out salient features/evaluation of existing mechanisms.;;2013;Acharya, Shreenath & D'Mello, Demian Antony;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6823543;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;12;"Energy Efficient Geographical Load Balancing viaDynamic Deferral of Workload";With the increasing popularity of Cloud computing and Mobile computing, individuals, enterprises and research centers have started outsourcing their IT and computational needs to on-demand cloud services. Recently geographical load balancing techniques have been suggested for data centers hosting cloud computation in order to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, these algorithms do not draw distinction among diverse requirements for responsiveness across various workloads. In this paper, we use the flexibility from the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to differentiate among workloads under bounded latency requirements and propose a novel approach for cost savings for geographical load balancing. We investigate how much workload to be executed in each data center and how much workload to be delayed and migrated to other data centers for energy saving while meeting deadlines. We present an offline formulation for geographical load balancing problem with dynamic deferral and give online algorithms to determine the assignment of workload to the data centers and the migration of workload between data centers in order to adapt with dynamic electricity price changes. We compare our algorithms with the greedy approach and show that significant cost savings can be achieved by migration of workload and dynamic deferral with future electricity price prediction. We validate our algorithms on MapReduce traces and show that geographic load balancing with dynamic deferral can provide 20-30 % cost-savings.;;2012;"Adnan, Muhammad Abdullah; Sugihara, Ryo & Com, Usa Amazon.";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.396.2492;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;13;An Approach to Build Multi-tenant SaaS Application with Monitoring and SLA;SaaS (Software as a Service) is a modern approach to deliver large scalable enterprise software as a service on Internet. Cloud computing platform provides the scalability, availability and utility computing for services on Internet. There are many technical challenges involved in SaaS development. One of them is multi-tenancy, which allows single instance of software to serve multiple organizations by accommodating their unique requirements through configuration at the same time. SaaS architecture requires the both configuration and some level of customization to achieve higher maturity model. In this paper, we proposed a metadata driven SaaS architecture, which is independent of underlying cloud infrastructure. Proposed architecture includes monitoring, tenant management, tenant administration, tenant configuration and large data management services. In our proposed architecture, we used Memcached concept and it is supported by almost all databases to boost the performance. In addition to this, we have considered application pooling on web server to manage priority among tenants.;;2012;"Aghera, Piyush; Chaudhary, Sanjay & Kumar, Vikas";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2223952.2224325 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6200688;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;14;Enhanced Proximity-Based Routing Policy for Service Brokering in Cloud Computing;Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (applications) as services, which are made available to consumers as subscription-based services under the pay-as-you-go model. CloudAnalyst is a tool that helps developers to simulate large-scale Cloud applications with the purpose of understanding performance of such applications under various deployment configurations. CloudAnalyst deploys different service brokering policies depending on the requirements of the cloud application. The proximity-based routing policy selects nearest data center without taking into account the response time. At times, the proximity-based routing policy may cause overloading of the closest data center. I propose an enhanced proximity-based routing policy that redirects a part/whole of the traffic to the next nearest datacenter in the same region and thereby, reduces overloading of the closest datacenter and avoids SLA violation.;;;Ahmed, A.

The cost on maintaining a data service centre in an average hospital may be substantial both on infrastructure and qualified ICT staff. The availability of large storage capacities and computing resources from Cloud Service Providers (CSP) is seen as an opportunity to save investment by outsourcing information services. Electronic Patient Record (EPR) management is sensitive issue which requires a foolproof security. It is extremely important to develop methods to relieve the clients from problems of security, integrity, availability and cross CSP mobility. We present E-Healthcare models for ubiquitous services for data acquisition archiving and presentation in Cloud.

It has changed paradigms of development, release, and maintenance of diverse types of software and service. However, this big movement has not been applied to real-time applications yet because deploying real-time applications on the cloud infrastructures arouses many controversies because of numerous uncertainties from sharing physical resources. It is not trivial to apply conventional scheduling techniques for real-time systems to cloud infrastructures without further considerations. All virtual machines (VMs) must be controlled by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) which is centralized and has a primary role to share physical resources fairly with all VMs in the same physical machine (PM). For best-effort applications, this fair resource sharing policy works well and end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) is promised by the service level agreement (SLA) with reasonable delay windows. However, for real-time applications with aperiodic hard- and soft-real-time tasks, this mechanism has serious weaknesses. Although VMMs of most cloud infrastructures have auto-scaling and load-balancing mechanisms, these are unpredictably slow to accept urgent aperiodic-real-time tasks because of its fair resource sharing policy. Therefore, it is necessary to propose another approach to satisfy deadline constraints of real-time tasks transferred from remote locations. In this research, we focus on cloud medical applications processing sensitive patient data with deadline constraints. We propose feasible solutions to reserve computing and networking resources with an autonomic computing architecture in the virtual private cloud infrastructures.;;2013;Ahn, Yong Woon & Cheng, Albert Mo Kim;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2518148.2518153;ACM;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;17;SLA Based Scheduler for Cloud for Storage \& Computational Services;The proposed work gives novel technique to exploit the cloud for the purpose of qualitative improvement in services being rendered. In this context a service level agreement is executed between the service provider and the user incorporating stipulations regarding terms \& conditions relevant with the transactions. Agreement envisages the provisioning of services to the users at the appointed time and charges commensurate with the market scenario. Besides the interests of the service providers are equally watched upon by allowing negotiations and settlements at par with prevailing market trends, thus ensuring benefits to both the service providers and the users. The scheduler algorithm allows re-provisioning of resources on the cloud in the event of failures.

For this reason, these mobile WS are expected to become ubiquitous, as they may be offered by any connected device. Previously, we presented a concept of protecting such mobile WS by using Service Level Agreements (SLA) on mobile devices, where we explained the four primary architectural components of the SLA framework and classified their functions into four fundamental life cycles. In continuation of that, here, we present the detailed performance analysis of the SLA framework, while taking into account the SOAP and REST service access interfaces.

We saw an opportunity to determine the optimum service level that minimizes the cost of delay in offering a service and made it our goal. Most researchers have approached this using the exogenous non-priority queue model; which would have been useful where service offerings are not differentiated. Our approach uses the Non-Preemptive queuing modeling. In this approach, the queuing theory is used to get our measure of effectiveness which is then used in our cost model to determine the optimal service level.

At the same time, service providers must seek to honour service level agreements (SLA) regarding performance and availability. In this paper we describe and analyse a class of attacks that may target other workloads or the ability of a service provider to satisfy SLA requirements by launching tightly coordinated attack or attack sequence. The attack seeks to utilise resource over-commitment and the cost of migration and related secondary effects such as power management rather than relying on implementation-specific weaknesses that could be mitigated more easily. The effectiveness of the attack depends on the ability to co-locate and precisely modulate workloads of virtual machines (VMs) on a single host. We describe a novel coordination protocol relying on broadcast primitives in memory-based covert channels for dynamic attack group membership and attack initiation based on a broadcast variant of the Jarecki-Kim-Tsudik (JKT) protocol.

However, one of the major challenges that face the cloud computing concept and its global acceptance is how to secure and protect the data that is the property of the user. The geographic location of cloud data storage centres is an important issue for many organisations and individuals due to the regulations and laws that require data and operations to reside in specific geographic locations. Thus, data owners may need to ensure that their cloud providers do not compromise the SLA contract and move their data into another geographic location. This paper introduces an architecture for a new approach for geographic location assurance, which combines the proof of storage protocol (POS) and the distance-bounding protocol. This allows the client to check where their stored data is located, without relying on the word of the cloud provider.

If the QoS guarantees are not upheld, typically the cloud provider is assessed some penalties, such as a payment credit for the customer. Monitoring and enforcing the SLA is an area of open research, and in this research we present the foundations towards a full realization of an SLA monitoring infrastructure. We proposed a formal model that can precisely describe both the SLA QoS guarantees and the penalties assessed for violation. Also, we implemented the proposed model as a dynamic SLA monitoring infrastructure system which is used for automatic SLA enforcement efficiently.

Cloud computing delivers scalable and on-demand services to most users in different domains. However, this new technology has also created many challenges for service providers and customers, especially for those users who already own complicated legacy systems. This paper reviews the challenges related to the concepts of trust, SLA management, and cloud computing. We begin with a survey of cloud computing architecture. Then, we discuss existing frameworks of service level agreements in different domains such as web services and grid computing.

In cloud computing, the online services are conducted to be pay-as-you-use. Service customers need not be in a long term contract with service providers. Service level agreements (SLAs) are agreements signed between a service provider and another party such as a service consumer, broker agent, or monitoring agent. Because cloud computing is a recent technology providing many services for critical business applications, reliable and flexible mechanisms to manage online contracts are very important. This paper presents the main criteria which should be considered at the stage of designing the SLA in cloud computing. Also, we investigate the negotiation strategies between cloud provider and cloud consumer and propose our method to maintain the trust and reliability between each of the parties involved in the negotiation process.;;2010;"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam & Chang, Elizabeth";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5610586;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;29;SLA-Based Trust Model for Cloud Computing;Cloud computing is a new form of technology, which infrastructure, developing platform, software, and storage can be delivered as a service in a pay as you use cost model.

Users pay for their use of services without needing to spend massive amounts for integration, maintenance, or management of the IT infrastructure. This creates the need for a reliable measurement methodology of the scalability for this type of new paradigm of services. In this paper, we develop performance metrics to measure and compare the scalability of the resources of virtualization on the cloud data centres. First, we discuss the need for a reliable method to compare the performance of cloud services among a number of various services being offered. Second, we develop a different type of metrics and propose a suitable methodology to measure the scalability using these types of metrics. We focus on the visualization resources such as CPU, storage disk, and network infrastructure. Finally, we compare well-known cloud providers using the proposed approach and conclude the recommendations. This type of research will help cloud consumers, before signing any official contract to use the desired services, to ascertain the ability and capacity of the cloud providers to deliver a particular service.;;2010;"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam; Wu, Chen & Chang, Elizabeth";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1967486.1967579;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;31;Cloud monitoring for optimizing the QoS of hosted applications;"Cloud monitoring involves dynamically tracking the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters related to virtualized services (e.g., CPU, storage, network, appliances, etc.), the physical resources they share, and the applications running on them or data hosted on them.

We model a cloud service using queuing theory. Using that model we build two adaptive proactive controllers that estimate the future load on a service. We explore the different possible scenarios for deploying a proactive elasticity controller coupled with a reactive elasticity controller in the cloud. Using simulation with workload traces from the FIFA world-cup web servers, we show that a hybrid controller that incorporates a reactive controller for scale up coupled with our proactive controllers for scale down decisions reduces SLA violations by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to a regression based controller or a completely reactive controller.;;2012;"Ali-Eldin, Ahmed; Tordsson, J. & Elmroth, E.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6211900;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;33;Modelling and comparing cloud computing service level agreements;Service-level agreements are a critical mechanism underpinning the pay-per-consumption model of business for cloud computing.

We introduce a costing tool that allows application owners (i.e., consumers) and the cloud service provider to assess the cost of a desired data sharing. The costing tool enables the consumers to effectively explore the cost space by choosing between alternative configurations of varying data qualities, specified by the staleness and the accuracy of the data sharing. In other words, staleness and accuracy requirements on the data sharing are used as levers for controlling costs. These capabilities are implemented in a What-if analysis tool, which has been integrated with a large data-sharing platform. We conducted extensive experiments on the integrated platform with a sharing ecosystem created around Twitter data and show the effectiveness of the results produced by the What-if tool.;;2013;"Al-Kiswany, Samer; Hacıg\""{u}m\""{u}_, Hakan; Liu, Ziyang & Sankaranarayanan, Jagan";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2452376.2452447;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;35;Furthering the growth of cloud computing by providing privacy as a service;The evolution of Cloud Computing as a viable business solution for providing hardware and software has created many security concerns. Among these security concerns, privacy is often overlooked. If Cloud Computing is to continue its growth, this privacy concern will need to be addressed. In this work we discuss the current growth of Cloud Computing and the impact the public sector and privacy can have in furthering this growth. To begin to provide privacy protection for Cloud Computing, we introduce privacy constraints that outline privacy preferences. We propose the expansion of Cloud Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to include these privacy constraints as Quality of Service (QoS) levels. This privacy QoS must be agreed upon along with the rest of the QoS terms within the SLA by the Cloud consumer and provider. Finally, we introduce Privacy as a Service (PraaS) to monitor the agreement and provide enforcement if necessary.;;2011;Allison, David S. & Capretz, Miriam A.

Powering a middle-sized data center normally consumed 80,000kW power every year and computer servers consume around 5\% of the global power [1]. In order to address the skyrocket energy cost from the high level resource management aspect, we propose an energy efficient job scheduling approach based on a modified version of Weighted Round Robin scheduler that incorporates VMs reuse and live VM migration without compromising the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Enhanced Weighted Round Robin (EWRR) algorithm enhanced scheduler can monitor the running VMs status for possible VM consolidation or Migration. In addition, VM Manager observes the VMs utilization rate to start live migration from the over-utilizing Processing Element (PE) to under-utilized PEs or to the hibernated PEs by sending WOL (Wake-On-LAN) signal to activate them.

We argue that by diversifying the selection, we can improve the dependability of the application and reduce risks associated with Service Level Agreements (SLA) violations. We propose a novel dynamic adaptive search based software engineering approach, which uses portfolio theory to construct a diversify portfolio of web service instances, traded from multiple Cloud providers.

We propose a mathematical model to predict the risk of failure of resources in such environments using a discrete-time analytical model driven by reliability functions fitted to observed data. The model relies on the resource historical data so as to predict the risk of failure for a given time interval. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted risk of failure with the observed risk of failure, and is shown to accurately predict the resources risk of failure, allowing a service provider to selectively choose which SLA request to accept.;;2014;Alsoghayer, Raid & Djemame, Karim;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121213002331 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2565887.2566076;Elsevier Science Inc.;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;40;Intelligent agents for automated cloud computing negotiation;Presently, cloud providers offer “off-the-shelf” Service Level Agreements (SLA), on a “take it or leave it” basis.

Traditional negotiations between humans are often fraught with difficulty. Thus, in this work, the use of intelligent agents to represent cloud providers and consumers is advocated.

Our approach recommends that an independent neutral third party entity monitors services offered by public CSPs to ensure that the SLAs offered to the clients are honored by the provider. The proposed entity can reduce the likelihood of disputes between the CSP and its customers, since we argue that there is a conflict of interest when a given CSP offers quality of service (QoS) reporting to its customers, because customers cannot independently verify the accuracy of such QoS reports in many cases, as discussed in this paper.;;2012;Alsulaiman, Laith A. & Alturki, Raad;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6320195;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;42;A Dynamic Bandwidth Allocator for Virtual Machines in a Cloud;Cloud computing is an emergent paradigm that allows to customers to rent infrastructure, platforms and software as a service.

Although the utilization of these services has triggered significant growth in several areas such as science, communication, education and health-care, to name a few, it has not come without a cost. Specifically, the operation of large-scale infrastructures can result in energy consumptions equivalent to the energy budget of a medium-sized city. The deployment of such infrastructures requires hunders of kgs of primary materials and fossil fuels, while releasing significant amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere.Energy is wasted across all layers of large-scale systems. One significant source of inefficiency is the overprovisioning of the hardware. Internet-services have typically very strict performance guarantees, defined in Service-Level Agreements, which result in overprovisioning of both the computing and the supporting equipment. The manufacturing of the extra equipment is a burden to the environment. The operation of the computing equipment at periods of low-utilization, which is the majority of the time, wastes a lot of energy because server HW tends to be energy-inefficient at low utilizations. Another significant source of inefficiency is the software, which is not designed both to maximize energy-savings and optimize performance.In datacenter planning, industry experts utilize methodologies to calculate the total cost/profit. We propose to include the environmental cost in current methodologies. With this, we demonstrate that large installations can be more energy-efficient compared to smaller ones. To tackle the cluster overprovisioning problem, researchers have proposed both HW and SW solutions. In HW, researchers have proposed the usage of low-power servers which transition all the server components into a low-power state fast. In SW, algorithms which consolidate the load into a subset of servers at periods of low utilization have been proposed. Unfortunately these solutions do not allow access to the memory during load consolidation, even though memory is a critical resource for the performance of internet-services. We propose both a memory-active, low-power family of server states and cluster middleware software which enables the management of the memory during consolidation. Our energy-efficient SW and HW achieve up to 38% energy savings in a datacenter cluster running an internet-service, over an energy-oblivious cluster. At the server level, dynamic power management solutions for the CPU and the DRAM may degrade performance with application complexities, such as highly dynamic loads or strided memory access patterns. We propose an SLA-aware power governor for the CPU and a locality-aware power management technique for the DRAM. Our CPU technique saves up to 8% system energy over the default power governor of the Linux kernel for a highly dynamic enterprise workload, while our DRAM technique improves the ED2 by 21% on average for an enterprise and scientific suite of benchmarks over a static-only power-optimized memory system.Overall, this thesis demonstrates that large-scale systems have the capacibility to be more energy-efficient, so long that energy-efficiency is integrated as a design goal throughout the large-scale system stack.";;2012;Anagnostopoulou, Vlasia;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2521009;University of California at Santa Barbara;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;46;Always On: Architecture for High Availability Cloud Applications;With the shift towards cloud computing, application availability becomes a valid concern. Cloud applications have to be taken down to address various hardware and software problems. Even thoug redundancy insulates applications from hardware errors, the software updates and patches still require the service to be taken down for the period of the update. Organizations generally use lowactivity hours to do software updates. This paper proposes architecture for constructing high-availability cloud applications that can be updated without shutting down the service. The paper discusses how the various components of application can be structured into request receiver nodes and request processor nodes. Request receivers receive the request and request processors act on the request. We provide a mechanism of detecting whether any worker or responder node is not working optimally and allow user to save the state and restart this particular node. Finally we present scenarios wherein these nodes can be upgraded either individually or in batches. This reduces dependency on administrators and operations engineers in data center thereby reducing the cost. The reduced cost can directly benefit cost sensitive emerging markets. Furthermore this improves the service level agreement (SLA) since the application will not have to be taken down for updates.;;2012;Anand, Manu;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6354593;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;47;A Scalable Architecture for Real-Time Monitoring of Large Information Systems;Data centers supporting cloud-based services are characterized by a huge number of hardware and software resources often cooperating in complex and unpredictable ways.

We propose a novel monitoring architecture that, by combining a hierarchical approach with decentralized monitors, addresses these challenges. In this context, fully centralized systems do not scale to the required number of flows, while pure peer-to-peer architectures cannot provide a global view of the system state.

Each host operated by a provider serves hundreds to thousands of users, treating their PCs as thin clients. Tapping the processing, storage and networking capacities of these non-dedicated resources promises to reduce the size of required hardware basis significantly. Consequently, it presents a noteworthy opportunity for service providers and operators of cloud computing infrastructures. We investigate how a mixture of dedicated (and so highly available) hosts and non-dedicated (and so highly volatile) hosts can be used to provision a processing tier of a large-scale web service. We discuss an operational model which guarantees long-term availability despite of host churn, and study multiple aspects necessary to implement it. These include: ranking of non-dedicated hosts according to their long-term availability behavior, short-term availability modeling of these hosts, and simulation of migration and group availability levels using real-world availability data from 10,000 non-dedicated hosts. We also study the tradeoff between a larger share of dedicated hosts vs. higher migration rate in terms of costs and SLA objectives. This yields an optimization approach where a service provider can find a suitable balance between costs and service quality. The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve a wide spectrum of such modes, ranging from 3.6 USD/hour to 5 USD/hour for a group of at least 50 hosts available with probability greater than 0.90.;;2010;"Andrzejak, Artur; Kondo, Derrick & Anderson, David P.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5488488 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.156.4276;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;49;Decision Model for Cloud Computing under SLA Constraints;With the recent introduction of Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), users can bid for resources and thus control the balance of reliability versus monetary costs.

Depending on the status of the demand, Infrastructure as a Service provider is able to offer higher or lower prices for maximising its profit. So it is difficult to establish a profitable pricing function for Software as a Service Providers. Therefore, this paper proposes spot pricing strategy to estimate the bid according to the used specified constraints of the user and also optimizing the pricing level to improve the profit of Saas providers.

We propose using a dynamically generated scaling model for the VMs containing the services of the distributed applications, which is able to react to the variations in the number of application users. We answer the following question: How to dynamically decide how many services of each type are needed in order to handle a larger workload within the same time constraints? We describe a mechanism for dynamically composing the SLAs for controlling the scaling of distributed services by combining data analysis mechanisms with application benchmarking using multiple VM configurations. Based on processing of multiple application benchmarks generated data sets we discover a set of service monitoring metrics able to predict critical Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. By combining this set of predictor metrics with a heuristic for selecting the appropriate scaling-out paths for the services of distributed applications, we show how SLA scaling rules can be inferred and then used for controlling the runtime scale-in and scale-out of distributed services. We validate our architecture and models by performing scaling experiments with a distributed application representative for the enterprise class of information systems.

Capacity allocation solutions are integrated with a load redirection mechanism which, when necessary, distributes incoming requests among different sites. The overall goal is to minimize the costs of allocated resources in terms of virtual machines, while guaranteeing SLA constraints expressed as a threshold on the average response time.

Currently, the cloud offer is becoming wider day by day because all the major IT companies and service providers, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, HP, IBM, and VMWare, have started providing solutions involving this new technological paradigm. As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic, the development of efficient service provisioning policies becomes increasingly challenging.

The speed of change in Internet Technologies continues to be impressive and the current “Future Internet” based society increasingly relies on software at all levels. Nevertheless, software systems continue to suffer from aging symptoms caused by the inherent factors of the software modernization process: inevitable; unpredictable; costly; difficult; time- and resource-consuming; poorly supported by tools, techniques or formalisms; poorly understood and maintained; undervalued in traditional software development processes, etc. Furthermore, current technological and business innovations (such as Cloud Computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) concepts) are changing the way in which software is designed, developed, tested, delivered and consumed. All this means that new requirements, never seen before in software development, have to be faced (scalability, multi-tenancy support, usage monitoring, security, SLA compliance, etc.). These challenges are even greater when adapting previously developed software to this new landscape. Different approaches (reverse engineering, ADM, or service-oriented-architecture modernization) have to be analyzed depending on the source language, architecture, target market or available resources. As a result, the complete software life cycle, from requirements to runtime and delivery, has to be re-adapted to the new technological and business conditions, needs and challenges, thus increasing the need of advanced means to support software evolution and adaptation as a key value for the next-generation service-based software modernization. One particular example of complex system modernization is the exposure of legacy systems as SaaS. Model-driven techniques have been used for several years to cope with the challenge of transformation of legacy systems as SaaS. Regardless of the positive features of these techniques, for legacy systems there are many challenges such as are the availability of arc- itectural models describing the system (typically unavailable for legacy systems), the ability to transform the original system into new ones compatible with targeted infrastructures and frameworks, and the support for adaptive deployment. All these features are particular relevant when deploying legacy applications as SaaS on the Web, for instance using different Cloud offerings. Desirable solutions are those that can automate the transformation of existing legacy systems that require being transformed into modern ones exposed as services (SaaS) compatible with modern technology frameworks. This keynote will present the challenges and needs, as well as the results obtained so far in this novel architecture and business model based on the cloud.";;2012;Arrieta, Leire Orue-Echevarria;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6392595;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;62;Self-Control Cloud Services;We introduce a self-control integrated service component aiming at ensuring Service Level Agreement management.

This variation in electrical power availability is represented in its dynamically changing price that can be used to drive workload deferral against performance requirements. But such deferral may cause user dissatisfaction. In this paper, we quantify the impact of deferral on user satisfaction and utilize flexibility from the service level agreements (SLAs) for deferral to adapt with dynamic price variation. We differentiate among the jobs based on their requirements for responsiveness and schedule them for energy saving while meeting deadlines and user satisfaction. Representing utility as decaying functions along with workload deferral, we make a balance between loss of user satisfaction and energy efficiency. We model delay as decaying functions and guarantee that no job violates the maximum deadline, and we minimize the overall energy cost. Our simulation on MapReduce traces show that energy consumption can be reduced by _15%, with such utility-aware deferred load balancing. We also found that considering utility as a decaying function gives better cost reduction than load balancing with a fixed deadline.;;;unknown Authors;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.396.3998;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;64;"Towards a Trust Management System for Cloud ComputingMarketplaces: using CAIQ as a trust information source";Cloud computing enables IT related services in a more dynamic and scalable way than before – more costeffective than before due to the economy of scale and of sharing resources. Usually, cloud providers describe their promised behaviour – regarding functional and non-functional aspects of the service provision – by way of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). For different providers offering similar functionality, SLAs are often insufficiently claimable and inconsistent with the aspects considered important by customers. Therefore, customers face problems identifying a trustworthy cloud provider based solely on its SLA. In order to support customers in reliably identifying trustworthy cloud providers, we propose a multi-faceted Trust Management (TM) system architecture for cloud computing marketplaces and related approaches. This system provides the means for identifying trustworthy cloud providers in terms of different attributes, e.g., compliance, data governance, information security. In this article, we present the first realization of our proposed TM system using the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ), initiated by the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA), as one of the sources of trust information. In particular, our proposed approach contributes to the challenge of extracting trust information from CAIQs completed by cloud providers. Finally, our implemented system and related approaches are experimented using real datasets.

Resource management and resource utilization are very much significant in the area of virtual desktop cloud computing. Handling a large amount of clients in most efficient manner is the main challenge in this field. This is because we have to ensure maximum resource utilization along with user data confidentiality, customer satisfaction, scalability, minimum SLA violation etc. Assigning too many users to one server may cause overloaded condition and which will lead to customer dissatisfaction. Assigning too little load will result in high investment cost. So we have taken in to consideration these two situations also. Here the proposed Rule Based Resource Management (RBRM) scheme assures the above mentioned parameters like minimum SLA violation. The concept of virtual desktop cloud computing is extended to a hybrid cloud environment. This is because to make the private cloud scalable. And priorities are assigned to user requests in order to maintain their confidentiality.

Arbitrary colocation of applications with different SLAs on a single host may result in inefficient utilization of the host's resources. In this paper, we propose that periodic resource allocation and consumption models -- often used to characterize real-time workloads -- be used for a more granular expression of SLAs. Our proposed SLA model has the salient feature that it exposes flexibilities that enable the infrastructure provider to safely transform SLAs from one form to another for the purpose of achieving more efficient colocation. Towards that goal, we present MORPHOSYS: a framework for a service that allows the manipulation of SLAs to enable efficient colocation of arbitrary workloads in a dynamic setting. We present results from extensive trace-driven simulations of colocated Video-on-Demand servers in a cloud setting.

TaaS (Testing-as-a-Service) promotes a Cloud-based testing architecture to provide online testing services following a pay-per-use business model. The paper introduces the research and implementation of a TaaS system called Vee@Cloud. It serves as a scalable virtual test lab built upon Cloud infrastructure services. The resource manager allocates Virtual Machine instances and deploy test tasks, from a pool of available resources across different Clouds. The workload generator simulates various workload patterns, especially for system with new architecture styles like Web 2.0 and big data processing. Vee@Cloud promotes continuous monitoring and evaluating of online services. The monitor collects real-time performance data and analyzes the data against SLA (Service Level Agreement).

One way for administrators to specify goals for such optimization problems effectively is using policies. Over the past decade, researchers produced various approaches, models and techniques for policy specification in different areas including distributed systems, communications networks, web services, autonomic computing, and cloud computing. Research challenges range from characterizing policies for ease of specification in particular application domains to categorizing policies for achieving solution qualities for particular algorithmic techniques.The contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, we give a mathematical formulation for each of the three policy types, action, goal and utility function policies, introduced in the policy framework by Kephart and Walsh. In particular, we introduce a first precise characterization of goal policies for optimization problems. Secondly, this paper introduces a mathematical framework that adds structure to the underlying optimization problem for different types of policies. Structure is added either to the objective function or the constraints of the optimization problem. These mathematical structures, imposed on the underlying problem, progressively increase the quality of the solutions obtained when using the greedy optimization technique. Thirdly, we show the applicability of our framework by analyzing several optimization problems encountered in self-adaptive and selfmanaging systems, such as resource allocation, quality of service management, and SLA profit optimization to provide quality guarantees for their solutions.Our approach is based on the algorithmic frameworks by Edmonds, Fisher et al., and Mestre, and the policy framework of Kephart and Walsh. Our characterization and approach will help designers of self-adaptive and self-managing systems formulate optimization problems, decide on algorithmic strategies based on policy requirements, and reason about solution qualities.";;2011;"Balasubramanian, Sowmya; Desmarais, Ron; M\""{u}ller, Hausi A.; Stege, Ulrike & Venkatesh, S.";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1988008.1988019;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;85;Making the Venus Concept Watch 1.0;"Over the past year we have celebrated the 50th anniversary of planetary exploration, which started with the Venus flyby of Mariner-2; and the 35th anniversary of the Pioneer-Venus multi-probe mission where one large and three small probes descended to the surface of Venus, encountering extreme environmental conditions. At the surface of Venus the temperature is about 460°C, and the pressure is 92bar, with a highly corrosive super-critical CO2 atmosphere. At a Venusian altitude of 50km the pressure and temperature conditions are near Earth-like, but the clouds carry sulfuric acid droplets. Deep probe missions to Jupiter and Saturn, targeting the 100bar pressure depth encounter similar pressure and temperature conditions as the Pioneer-Venus probes did. Mitigating these environments is highly challenging and requires special considerations for designs and materials. While assessing such space mission concepts, we have found that there is an overlap between the extreme environments in planetary atmospheres and the environments experienced by deep-sea explorers back on Earth. Consequently, the mitigation approaches could be also similar between planetary probes and diver watches. For example, both need to tolerate about 100bar of pressure—although high temperatures are not factors on Earth. Mitigating these environments, the potential materials are: titanium for the probe and the watch housing; sapphire for the window and glass; resin impregnated woven carbon fiber for the aeroshell_s thermal protection system and for the face of the watch; and nylon ribbon for the parachute and for the watch band. Planetary probes also utilize precision watches; thus there is yet another crosscutting functionality with diver watches. Our team, from the Innovation Design Engineering Program of the Royal College of Art, has designed and built a concept watch to commemorate these historical events, while highlighting advances in manufacturing processes over the past three to five decades, relevant to both future planetary mission designs and can be used to produce deep diver watches. In this paper we describe our design considerations; give a brief overview of the extreme environments these components would experience on both Venus and Earth; the manufacturing techniques and materials we used to build the Venus Watch; and its outreach potential to bring a distant concept of planetary exploration closer to Earth. We will also address lessons learned from this project and new ideas forward, for the next generation of this concept design.";;2014;Balint, Tibor S. & Melchiorri, Julian P.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576514001477;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;86;Quality Assessment of Software as a Service on Cloud Using Fuzzy Logic;"Cloud computing is a business model which provides on demand services on the pay-per-use premise. Software as a Service (SaaS) is one of the delivery models for cloud computing, where software ownership by the SaaS provider is isolated from its use by the SaaS customer. The notion of quality is central to any service provision. Also, it is important to evaluate the quality of SaaS in order to be able to improve it. Traditional software engineering quality models are not effusively suitable for this purpose due to difference in the nature of software and service. In the past, a few approaches to service quality estimation have been proposed. Some of these approaches extend quality characteristics from existing quality models and even devise SaaS quality metrics, while others discuss quality around Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, some representative quality factors have been identified by analyzing literature and a model based on fuzzy logic has been proposed to assess SaaS quality. Such a model of quality criteria may provide a ground for more comprehensive quality model which may assist a SaaS customer to choose a higher quality service from available services on cloud; the quality model may also serve as a guideline to SaaS provider to improve the quality of service provided.";;2013;Baliyan, Niyati & Kumar, Sandeep;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6684439;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;87;Predicting cloud resource provisioning using machine learning techniques;In order to meet Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements, Virtual Machine (VM) resources must be provisioned few minutes ahead due to the VM boot-up time.

Auto Scale allows users to scale their cloud resources capacity according to elastic loads timely, which has been widely used in mature public cloud. For private cloud, there are some different features from public cloud. It is more flexible to use Auto Scale technique to provide QoS guarantees and ensure system health. In this paper, we design a novel Auto Load-aware Scale scheme for private cloud environment. We describe scale in and scale out strategy based on prediction algorithm.

This is because the developer needs to acquire more information on the specific performance features of a cloud platform to better leverage its specificities.To support this goal, we have developed a set of open source components that extract quality-of-service (QoS) data from a target Java application using JMX, aggregate it in a time-series database, and finally deliver it in a prototype Java dashboard that may be integrated in a development environment, such as Eclipse, to display either live or historical QoS data. The architecture is not only limited to collection, aggregation, and display of QoS data, but it also allows the evaluation of hierarchical queries expressed using the Performance Trees graphical language. It is our intention that this will provide a cloud-independent uniform interface for developers to specify monitoring queries.

One of the major issues concerning both the cloud service providers and consumers is the automatic scalability of resources (i.e., compute, storage and bandwidth) in response to the highly unpredictable demands. To this end, an opportunity exists to harness the predictive and diagnostic capabilities of machine learning approaches to incorporate dynamic scaling up and scaling down of resources without violating the Service Level Agreements (SLA) and simultaneously ensuring adequate revenue to the providers. This paper proposes, implements and evaluates a Bayesian Networks based predictive modeling framework to provide for an autonomic scaling of utility computing resources in the Cloud Computing scenario. In essence, the BN-based model captures the historical behavior of the system involving various performance metrics (indicators) and predicts the desired unknown metric (e.g. SLA parameter).

Resource provisioning is usually guided by intuitive or heuristic expectation of performance and existing user model. Provisioning based on such methodology, however, usually leads to more resources than are actually necessary. While such overprovisioning may guarantee performance, this guarantee may come at a very high cost. A quantitative performance estimate may guide the provider in making informed decisions about the right level of resources, so that acceptable service performance may be provided in a cost-effective manner. A quantitative estimate of application performance must consider its workload characteristics. Due to the complex workload characteristics of commercial software, estimation of its performance and provisioning to optimize for cost is not straightforward. In this work we looked at breaking the application into isolated modalities (modality is a scenario in which an application is used, for example, instant messaging, and voice calls are two different modalities of a media application) and measuring resource cost per modality as an effective methodology to provision datacenters to optimize for performance and minimize cost. When breaking the application into modalities, resource cost is assessed in isolation. Results are then aggregated to estimate the overall resource provisioning requirements. A validation tool is used to simulate the load and validate the assumptions. This was applied to a commercially available solution and validated in a datacenter setting.";;;Bashroush, Rabih & Noureddine, Moustafa;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.426.7940;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;97;A Generic Architecture for Demand Response: The ALL4Green Approach;Demand Response is a mechanism used in power grids to manage customers' power consumption during critical situations (e.g. power shortage).

To this end, we show our three-level concept and then illustrate the building blocks of All4Green's architectural design. Furthermore, we introduce the novel aspects of Green SDA and Green SLA for Energy Provider-Data centre sub-ecosystem as well as Data centre-IT Client sub-ecosystem respectively. In order to further reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission, the notion of data centre federation is introduced: savings can be expected if data centres start to collaborate by exchanging workload.

More specifically, we assume on the one part that each computing resource is associated with a capacity, that can be chosen using the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) method, and with a probability of failure. On the other hand, we assume that the services run as a set of independent instances of identical Virtual Machines (VMs). Moreover, there exists a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Cloud provider and the client that can be expressed as follows: the client comes with a minimal number of service instances that must be alive at anytime, and the Cloud provider offers a list of pairs (price, compensation), the compensation having to be paid by the Cloud provider if it fails to keep alive the required number of services. On the Cloud provider side, each pair actually corresponds to a guaranteed reliability of fulfilling the constraint on the minimal number of instances. In this context, given a minimal number of instances and a probability of success, the question for the Cloud provider is to find the number of necessary resources, their clock frequency and an allocation of the instances (possibly using replication) onto machines. This solution should satisfy all types of constraints (both capacity and reliability constraints). Moreover, it should remain valid during a time period (with a given reliability in presence of failures) while minimizing the energy consumption of used resources. We assume in this paper that this time period, that typically takes place between two redistributions, is fixed and known in advance. We prove deterministic approximation ratios on the consumed energy for algorithms that provide guaranteed reliability and we provide an extensive set of simulations that prove that homogeneous solutions are close to optimal.;;2013;"Beaumont, Olivier; Duchon, Philippe & Renaud-Goud, Paul";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.414.1618 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6799123;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;99;Reliable Service Allocation in Clouds;We consider several reliability problems that arise when allocating applications to processing resources in a Cloud computing platform. More specifically, we assume on the one hand that each computing resource is associated to a capacity constraint and to a probability of failure. On the other hand, we assume that each service runs as a set of independent instances of identical Virtual Machines, and that the Service Level Agreement between the Cloud provider and the client states that a minimal number of instances of the service should run with a given probability. In this context, given the capacity and failure probabilities of the machines, and the capacity and reliability demands of the services, the question for the cloud provider is to find an allocation of the instances of the services (possibly using replication) onto machines satisfying all types of constraints during a given time period. In this paper, our goal is to assess the impact of the reliability constraint on the complexity of resource allocation problems. We consider several variants of this problem, depending on the number of services and whether their reliability demand is individual or global. We prove several fundamental complexity results (\#P' and NP-completeness results) and we provide several optimal and approximation algorithms. In particular, we prove that a basic randomized allocation algorithm, that is easy to implement, provides optimal or quasi-optimal results in several contexts, and we show through simulations that it also achieves very good results in more general settings.;;2013;"Beaumont, Olivier; Eyraud-Dubois, Lionel & Larcheveque, Hubert";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2510661.2511428 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6569800;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;100;Reliable Service Allocation in Clouds with Memory and Capacity Constraints;We consider allocation problems that arise in the context of service allocation in Clouds.

On the other part, we assume that each application in the IaaS Cloud comes as a set of services running as Virtual Machines (VMs) on top of the set of PMs. In turn, each service requires a given quantity of each resource on each machine where it runs (memory footprint, CPU, disk, network). Moreover, there exists a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Cloud provider and the client that can be expressed as follows: the client requires a minimal number of service instances which must be alive at the end of the day, with a given reliability (that can be converted into penalties paid by the provider). In this context, the goal for the Cloud provider is to find an allocation of VMs onto PMs so as to satisfy, at minimal cost, both capacity and reliability constraints for each service.

These services are characterized by their demand along several dimensions (CPU, memory,...) and by their quality of service requirements, that have been defined through an SLA in the case of a public Cloud or fixed by the administrator in the case of a private Cloud. This quality of service defines the required robustness of the service, by setting an upper limit on the probability that the provider fails to allocate the required quantity of resources. This maximum probability of failure can be transparently turned into a pair (price, penalty). Failures can indeed hit the platform, and resilience is provided through service replication. Our contribution is two-fold. Firstly, we propose a resource allocation strategy whose complexity is logarithmic in the number of resources, what makes it very efficient for large platforms. Secondly, we propose an efficient algorithm based on rare events detection techniques in order to estimate the robustness of an allocation, a problem that has been proven to be #P-complete.

At the same time, the expectations of meeting SLAs is also growing amongst cloud customers. The competition has resulted in a lower prices and a better quality of service from most providers. Currently service providers offer a wide range of services (sizes of machine, availability, attached storage etc.) with complex pricing schemes (spot pricing, reservation pricing etc.). At the same time, customers have the need for distributed deployments of their applications driven by their own SLA commitments to customers around the world. The two factors taken together now necessitates the customer having to make a complex choice of deploying different applications and data blocks amongst a set of cloud providers. Optimizing cost, while meeting SLAs under this scenario is not easy - in this paper we look at deployment planning in the context of multi-site multi-cloud deployments and present a greedy heuristic to achieve the same.

Currently cloud providers offer a wide range of services (machine sizes, availability modes, storage etc.) with complex pricing schemes (spot pricing, reservation pricing, etc.). At the same time, customers require distributed deployments in order to meet their own SLA commitments. This has led to the concept of multi-site multi-cloud deployment schemes that allows enterprises to deploy highly performant distributed applications such as gaming using multiple cloud providers. Existing research has solved the problem of cost optimization of such deployments BUT under the assumption of a single pricing scheme for all providers. The introduction of varied and dynamic pricing introduces several complexities that needs a fresh look at this problem. In this paper we present a solution for mapping the compute and storage requirements of a set of related enterprise sites onto cloud providers who offer multiple, dynamic pricing schemes. Our goal is to optimize the cost of a multi-site deployment consisting of compute and storage components at each site while meeting SLA requirements of the application.

In addition, the IT business market has pumped enough revenue for establishing salient common-use cloud solutions. Despite adequate researchers have been involved in the cloud development, scientific application developers are still reluctant to execute their applications in the cloud due to the performance concerns, such as, scalability, availability, and service level agreement violations of the cloud providers. In this paper, a survey of various High Performance Computing (HPC) applications and possible performance concerns while executing applications in cloud is presented.

Resources are delivered to cloud consumers in the form of infrastructure, platform and software services. These resources are deployed on three different models: private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds. In hybrid cloud context, private clouds externalize resources and invoke services from a public cloud when needed. However, in such a specific inter-cloud environment risks may arise. In fact, private cloud users often interact with cloud providers for services provisioning such as infrastructure, platforms and software. However, they are not sufficiently assured about how credible the data computed by these resources they have entrusted. This is due to clouds autonomy preservation, difference in control policy definitions and lack of transparency in clouds. In this paper, we propose a preventive/detective approach for assessing private cloud to select a trustworthy public cloud service. The solution is based on a mediator as a service that ensures the role of trust manager for the private cloud.;;2014;"Bennani, Nadia; Boukadi, Khouloud & Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2681967.2682244 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6927079;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;112;SLA-Guided Data Integration on Cloud Environments;Existing data integration techniques have to be revisited to query big data collections on the Cloud.

From the network point of view, monitoring and optimizing performance for the traffic they generate is a challenging task, given the same resource can be located in multiple places, which can in turn change at any time. The first step in understanding Cloud and CDN systems is thus the engineering of a monitoring platform. In this paper, we propose a novel solution which combines passive and active measurements, and whose workflow has been tailored to specifically characterize the traffic generated by Cloud and CDN infrastructures. We validate our platform by performing a longitudinal characterization of the very well known Cloud and CDN infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS). By observing the traffic generated by more than 50,000 Internet users of an Italian ISP, we explore the EC2, S3 and CloudFront AWS services, unveiling their infrastructure, the pervasiveness of web-services they host, and their traffic allocation policies as seen from our vantage points. Most importantly, we observe their evolution over a twoyear long period. The solution provided in this paper can be of interest for i) developers aiming at building measurement tools for Cloud Infrastructure Providers, ii) developers interested in failure and anomaly detection systems, and iii) third-party SLA certificators who can design systems to independently monitor performance.

Here we propose a framework for autonomic scheduling of tasks and web-services on cloud environments, optimizing the profit taking into account revenue for task execution minus penalties for service-level agreement violations, minus power consumption cost. The principal contribution is the combination of consolidation and virtualization technologies, mathematical optimization methods, and machine learning techniques. The data-center infrastructure, tasks to execute, and desired profit are casted as a mathematical programming model, which can then be solved in different ways to find good task scheduling. We use an exact solver based on mixed linear programming as a proof of concept but, since it is an NP-complete problem, we show that approximate solvers provide valid alternatives for finding approximately optimal schedules. The machine learning is used to estimate the initially unknown parameters of the mathematical model. In particular, we need to predict a priori resource usage (such as CPU consumption) by different tasks under current workloads, and estimate task service-level-agreement (such as response time) given workload features, host characteristics, and contention among tasks in the same host. Experiments show that machine learning algorithms can predict system behavior with acceptable accuracy, and that their combination with the exact or approximate schedulers manages to allocate tasks to hosts striking a balance between revenue for executed tasks, quality of service, and power consumption.";;2011;"Berral, Josep Ll.; Gavald\`{a}, Ricard; Torres, Jordi & Gavalda, Ricard";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2082076.2082091 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6076500 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.297.376;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;116;Adaptive SLA monitoring of service choreographies enacted on the Cloud;The deployment and the execution of applications on dynamic Cloud infrastructures introduces new requirements of adaptability with respect to monitoring. Specifically, the governance of service choreographies enacted over Cloud-based solutions relies on the observation and analysis of events happening at different abstraction layers. Adaptability requirements are even more evident when monitoring deals with Service Level Agreements (SLA) established among the choreography participants. In fact, as the Cloud paradigm offers on-demand solutions as a service, often monitoring rules cannot be completely defined off-line. Thus also the monitoring infrastructure must keep track of the continuous evolution of the underlying environment, and adapt itself accordingly.

Accurately predicting response times of DBMS queries is necessary for a DBA to effectively achieve these goals. This task is particularly challenging due to the fact that a database workload typically consists of many concurrently running queries and an accurate model needs to capture their interactions. Additional challenges are introduced when DBMSes are run in dynamic cloud computing environments, where workload, data, and physical resources can change frequently, on-the-fly. Building an efficient and highly accurate online DBMS performance model that is robust in the face of changing workloads, data evolution, and physical resource allocations is still an unsolved problem. In this work, our goal is to build such an online performance model for database appliances using an experiment-driven modeling approach. We use a Bayesian approach and build novel Gaussian models that take into account the interaction among concurrently executing queries and predict response times of individual DBMS queries. A key feature of our modeling approach is that the models can be updated online in response to new queries or data, or changing resource allocations.

Yet few datacenters are automated this way in practice, due in part to well-founded skepticism about whether the simple models often used in the research literature can capture complex real-life workload/performance relationships and keep up with changing conditions that might invalidate the models.

The main motivation for considering such SLAs is their potential for price differentiation. We focus our analysis on the effects the penalty function has on the achieved response time percentiles. In particular, we analyze the effect of three commonly deployed choices (linear, exponential or step-wise functions) to relate the penalty charged and the achieved percentile.

Multiple SaaS providers host their SOA-based, context-aware applications in the cloud. Typically, the context-aware applications serve multiple classes of customers (end users) classified on economic considerations, which determine the Quality of Service (QoS) received by each class. This need for differentiated QoS for each customer class is incorporated into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiated between the context-aware application provider and the cloud provider. A QoS metric that has been explored in large distributed applications is the percentile of response times, this metric provides a form of guarantees on the shape of the response time distribution for the customer. Typical SLAs require the response time of a certain percentile of the input requests from particular classes of customers to be less than a specified value, if this value is exceeded, a penalty is charged to the cloud provider. In addition, the applications we consider are data-intensive with strict temporal order constraints that have to be enforced on requests within the same session of a customer. We propose Data-aware Session-grained Allocation with gi-FIFO Scheduling (DSAgS), a novel decentralized request management scheme deployed in each of the geographically distributed datacenters, to globally reduce the penalty charged to the cloud computing system.

In this paper, we propose a decentralized economic approach for dynamically adapting the cloud resources of various applications, so as to statistically meet their SLA performance and availability goals in the presence of varying loads or failures. According to our approach, the dynamic economic fitness of a Web service determines whether it is replicated or migrated to another server, or deleted. The economic fitness of a Web service depends on its individual performance constraints, its load, and the utilization of the resources where it resides. Cascading performance objectives are dynamically calculated for individual tasks in the application workflow according to the user requirements.

In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers. The use of concepts of Service Level Agreements - SLA to control the utilization of computational resources of a provider is common in computing environments and can be used to ensure the quality of services that being offered. The objective of this work is to combine these paradigms, cloud, models and SLA, in order to use the resources of a computational cloud to provide automatically a platform as a service - PaaS. This project will be developed in a web environment, using a model-driven approach to create the platforms and the management of resources and quality will be made by SLA.;;2012;"Borges, H.

Cloud providers sometimes just deliver services, but do not clearly define quality of services guarantees. In addition, each provider uses a particular process to provide services. In this way, aiming to define a service procurement process to clouds, this paper proposes an approach based on a cloud environment model, considering service quality preservation. The proposed process will use an environment model containing all relevant information to create a virtual workspace, taking into account requirements of hardware and software and quality parameters, all of them specified by users. From this model, it will be possible to automatically provide platform and infrastructure as a service. The agreement negotiation happens during the service acquisition process from automated agents, creating the services and monitoring their quality attributes, generating an environment less error-prone, increasing the customer level satisfaction.;;2012;"Borges, Helder Pereira; de Souza, Jose Neuman; de Souza, Jos\'{e} Neuman; Schulze, Bruno & Mury, Antonio Roberto";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6508155;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;135;Energy-efficient and SLA-aware management of IaaS clouds;Cloud computing utilizes arbitrary mega-scale computing infrastructures and is currently revolutionizing the ICT landscape by allowing remote access to computing power and data over the Internet. Besides the huge economical impact Cloud technology exhibits a high potential to be a cornerstone of a new generation of sustainable and energy-efficient ICT. The challenging issue thereby is the energy-efficient utilization of physical machines (PMs) and the resource-efficient management of virtual machines (VMs) while attaining promised non-functional qualities of service expressed by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently, there exist solutions for PM power management, VM migrations, and dynamic reconfiguration of VMs. However, most of the existing approaches consider each of them alone, and only use rudimentary concepts for migration costs or disrespect the nature of the highly volatile workloads. In this paper we present an integrated approach for VM migration and reconfiguration, and PM power management. Thereby, we incorporate an autonomic management loop, where proactive actions are suggested for all three areas in a hierarchically structured way. We evaluate our approach with both, synthetic workload data and real-word monitoring data of a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) application used for the protein folding in the bioinformatics area. The efficacy of our approach is evaluated by considering classical algorithms like First Fit, Monte Carlo and Vector Packing, adapted for energy-efficient reallocation.

Such dynamic pricing schemes help the power companies to modulate the aggregate demand of electricity based on the supply. Accordingly, cloud providers, which are often the largest consumers of electricity, should be able to respond to various dynamic pricing signals called demand response (DR) signals by autonomously moving identified applications to other cloud sites. This paper leverages the recent advancements in cloud migration technologies to 'intelligently' move applications across geographically distributed cloud sites at runtime after a DR signal is received by the cloud provider. This helps minimize the cost incurred by a cloud provider and yet provide adequate service level guarantees as stated in the service level agreements (SLA). The current work develops models and solution schemes for identifying suitable applications for migration and placing such applications on remote cloud sites to take advantages of pricing schemes such as the time-of-use pricing and real time pricing.;;2010;"Bose, Sumit Kumar; Salsburg, Michael A. & Mithani, Mohammad Firoj";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5622025;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;137;Automated control for SLA-aware elastic clouds;Although Cloud Computing provides a means to support remote, on-demand access top a set of computing resources, its ad-hoc management for quality-of-service and SLA poses significant challenges to the performance, availability and economical costs of the cloud.

Currently, many enterprises are adopting Clouds to achieve high performance and scalability for their applications while maintaining low costs. Service provisioning in the Cloud is based on a set of predefined nonfunctional properties specified and negotiated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Cloud workloads are dynamic and change constantly. Thus, in order to reduce steady human interactions, self-manageable Cloud techniques are required to comply with the agreed customers' SLAs. Flexible and reliable management of SLAs is of paramount importance for both, Cloud providers and consumers. On one hand, the prevention of SLA violations avoids penalties that are costly to providers. On the other hand, based on flexible and timely reactions to possible SLA violation threats, user interaction with the system can be minimized enabling Cloud computing to take roots as a flexible and reliable form of on-demand computing. Furthermore, a trade-off has to be found between proactive actions that prevent SLA violations and those that reduce energy consumption, i.e., increase energy efficiency.

In this work, we consider consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers (e.g., hosts or racks) in a cloud where the physical network (e.g., network interface or top of the rack switch link) may become a bottleneck. Since virtual machines do not simultaneously use maximum of their nominal bandwidth, the capacity of the physical container can be multiplexed. We assume that each virtual machine has a probabilistic guarantee on realizing its bandwidth Requirements-as derived from its Service Level Agreement with the cloud provider. Therefore, the problem of consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers, while preserving these bandwidth allocation guarantees, can be modeled as a Stochastic Bin Packing (SBP) problem, where each virtual machine's bandwidth demand is treated as a random variable. We consider both offline and online versions of SBP. Under the assumption that the virtual machines' bandwidth consumption obeys normal distribution, we show a 2-approximation algorithm for the offline version and improve the previously reported results by presenting a (2 +_)-competitive algorithm for the online version.

A Service owner profiles the service to determine its most appropriate sizing under different workload conditions. This variable sizing is formalized through a service level agreement (SLA) between the service owner and the cloud provider. The Cloud provider obtains maximum benefit when it succeeds to fully allocate the resource set demanded by the elastic service subject to its SLA. Failure to do so may result in SLA breach and financial losses to the provider. We define a novel combinatorial optimization problem called elastic services placement problem (ESPP) to maximize the provider's benefit from SLA compliant placement. We observe that ESPP extends the generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is a well studied combinatorial optimization problem. However, ESPP turns out to be considerably harder to solve as it does not admit a constant factor approximation. We show that using a simple transformation, ESPP can be presented as a multi-unit combinatorial auction. We further present a column generation method to obtain near optimal solutions for ESPP for large data centers where exact solutions cannot be obtained in a reasonable amount of time using a direct integer programming formulation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an extensive simulation study. Our results show that we are capable of consistently obtaining good solutions in a time efficient manner.

In order to address the issue of fragmentation, commodity Cloud marketplaces have been suggested. However, as those marketplaces still suffer from being static (i.e., not being capable to adapt to changing market conditions and to the dynamics of user requirements for services), they do not operate at the optimal point. In this paper, we address this issue by channeling demand and supply into a few standardized services that are automatically adapted to user requirements in regular time intervals. For this, we utilize clustering algorithms and monitor the requirements of users.

To counteract this problem, SLA templates (i.e., templates for electronic contracts) have been introduced. However, until now, SLA templates were static, not able to reflect changes in users ’ requirements. In this paper, we apply the adaptive SLA mapping approach for deriving public SLA templates from private SLA templates of users. To achieve the adaptation of SLA templates, we combine clustering algorithms with adaptation methods. The result is a set of new public SLA templates, which reflect the market situation more accurately. This way, we enable marketplaces to automatically adapt to observed changes of market conditions.

Usually, in Cloud markets, contracts between traders are established using Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which include objectives of service usage. However, Cloud markets face challenges, which are usually not evident in other market types, such as non-standardized goods and large variety of resource types offered on the market, resulting in low number of matches of consumers' bids and providers' asks. Moreover, existing Cloud market mechanisms are usually static and cannot react on dynamic change of user requirements. To counteract these problems, we propose an adaptive approach for autonomically deriving public SLA templates (i.e., templates for generation of electronic contracts) based on user requirements. Although this approach brings many benefits, it also incurs cost to users, since they must adapt specifications of their requirements in order to match automatically generated public SLA templates.

The facilities offered by these providers is leveraged by developers via provider-specific Web Service APIs. For content creators, these providers have emerged as a genuine alternative to dedicated Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for global file storage and delivery, as they are significantly cheaper, have comparable performance and no ongoing contract obligations. As a result, the idea of utilising Storage Clouds as a ‘poor mans ’ CDN is very enticing. However, many of these ‘Cloud Storage ’ providers are merely basic storage services, and do not offer the capabilities of a fully-featured CDN such as intelligent replication, failover, load redirection and load balancing. Furthermore, they can be difficult to use for non-developers, as each service is best utilised via unique web services or programmer APIs. In this paper we describe the design, architecture, implementation and user-experience of MetaCDN, a system that integrates these ‘Cloud Storage ’ providers into an unified CDN service that provides high performance, low cost, geographically distributed content storage and delivery for content creators, and is managed by an easy to use web portal.;;;Broberg, James & Tari, Zahir;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.151.2026;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;160;A Model-free Learning Approach for Coordinated Configuration of Virtual Machines and Appliances;Cloud computing has a key requirement for resource configuration in a real-time manner. In such virtualized environments, both virtual machines (VMs) and hosted applications need to be configured on-the-fly to adapt to system dynamics. The interplay between the layers of VMs and applications further complicates the problem of cloud configuration. Independent tuning of each aspect may not lead to optimal system wide performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, namely CoTuner, for coordinated configuration of VMs and resident applications. At the heart of the framework is a model-free hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which combines the advantages of Simplex and RL methods and is further enhanced by the use of system knowledge guided exploration policies. Experimental results on Xen-based virtualized environments with TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that CoTuner is able to drive a virtual server system into an optimal or near optimal configuration state dynamically, in response to the change of workload. It improves the systems throughput by more than 30\% over independent tuning strategies. In comparison with the coordinated tuning strategies based solely on Simplex or basic RL algorithm, the hybrid RL algorithm gains 30\% to 40\% throughput improvement. Moreover, the algorithm is able to reduce SLA violation of the applications by more than 80\%.;;2011;"Bu, Xiangping; Rao, Jia & Xu, Cheng-Zhong";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2060110.2060889 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6005364 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.298.693;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;161;Service level agreement framework for e-commerce cloud end-user perspective;Cloud computing provides a large pool of accessible resources (hardware, platform, software) in a form of services. It became a cost effective alternative to the traditional IT infrastructure.

The restricted choice of appropriate parameters in SLA affects the interacting of end user with cloud services and creates risks of user data. End users are concerned about their data and how it will be stored in cloud and how the data is recovered in the case of failure of disaster. However, none of SLAs consider the end user view while conducting the SLA document.

Due to the mandatory centralised control of license usage at application runtime, e.g. heartbeat control by the license server running at the home site of a user, traditional software licensing practices are not suitable especially when the distributed computing infrastructure stretches across administrative domains. In this paper we present a novel approach for managing software licenses as web service resources in distributed service oriented environments. Licenses become mobile objects, which may travel to the environment where required to authorise the execution of a license protected application. A first implementation has been realised for dynamic Grid environments in the European SmartLM project co-funded by the European Commission. The SmartLM solution decouples authorisation for license usage from authorisation for application execution. All authorisations are expressed as and guaranteed by Service Level Agreements.

One approach that can be taken to avoid such a scenario is enabling further growing of the application by scaling it across multiple, independent Cloud data centers, following market-based trading and negotiation of resources. This approach, as envisioned in the InterCloud project, is realized by agents called Cloud Coordinators and allows for an increase in performance, reliability, and scalability of elastic applications.

To maximize the profit, a service provider should understand both service charges and business costs, and how they are determined by the characteristics of the applications and the configuration of a multiserver system. The problem of optimal multiserver configuration for profit maximization in a cloud computing environment is studied. Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multiserver system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service provider's margin and profit. Our approach is to treat a multiserver system as an M/M/m queuing model, such that our optimization problem can be formulated and solved analytically. Two server speed and power consumption models are considered, namely, the idle-speed model and the constant-speed model. The probability density function of the waiting time of a newly arrived service request is derived. The expected service charge to a service request is calculated.

To this end, Contrail federations play a key role, allowing users to exploit resources belonging to different cloud providers, regardless of the kind of technology of the providers and with a homogeneous, secure interface. Vertical integration is achieved by developing both the Infrastructure- and the Platform-as-a-Service levels within the project. A third key point is the adoption of a fully open-source approach toward technology and standards. Beside supporting user authentication and applications deployment, Contrail federations aim at providing extended SLA management functionalities, by integrating the SLA management approach of SLA@SOI project in the federation architecture.;;2012;;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238356.2238377;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;184;User centric service level management in mOSAIC applications;Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aims at offering a simple and clear way to build up an agreement between the final users and the service provider in order to establish what is effectively granted by the cloud providers. In this paper we will show the SLA-related activities in mOSAIC, an european funded project that aims at exploiting a new programming model, which fully acquires the flexibility and dynamicity of the cloud environment, in order to build up a dedicated solution for SLA management. The key idea of SLA management in mOSAIC is that it is impossible to offer a single, static general purpose solution for SLA management of any kind of applications, but it is possible to offer a set of micro-functionalities that can be easily integrated among them in order to build up a dedicated solution for the application developer problem. Due to the mOSAIC API approach (which enable easy interoperability among moSAIC components) it will be possible to build up applications enriching them with user-oriented SLA management, from the very early development stages.;;;;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238436.2238451;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;185;SLM and SDM challenges in federated infrastructures;Federation of computing resources imposes challenges in service management not seen in simple customer-supplier relationships.

Cloud computing providers rely on virtualization techniques to manage the dynamic nature of their infrastructure allowing consumers to dynamically allocate and deallocate virtual machines of different capacities. Cloud providers need to optimally decide the best allocation of virtual machines to physical machines as the demand varies dynamically. When making such decisions, cloud providers can migrate VMs already allocated and/or use external cloud providers. This paper considers the problem in which the cloud provider wants to maximize its revenue, subject to capacity, availability SLA, and VM migration constraints. The paper presents a heuristic solution, called Near Optimal (NOPT), to this NP-hard problem and discusses the results of its experimental evaluation in comparison with a best fit (BF) allocation strategy. The results show that NOPT provides a 45% improvement in average revenue when compared with BF for the parameters used in the experiment.

Many solutions are now available in the literature, and most of them focus on modeling sensor networks as part of the infrastructure to be offered as a service (IaaS), directly managed by means of the Cloud tools that provide resource virtualization. We propose a different approach: sensor networks are modeled as providers that offer their resources to a Cloud application that runs independently from Cloud providers. Being offered as a Service, any user can negotiate with the provider his desired requirements in terms of operational parameters and non-functional features (i.e. security, dependability, etc).

However, the unreliability and unpredictability of these resources mean that their use in the context of a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is high risk, leading to a reduction in reputation as well as economic penalties in case of SLA violation. We propose a methodology that addresses the issues of unreliability and unpredictability such that Cloud software services could be hosted upon volunteered resources. To enable the harnessing of these resources we rely on autonomic fault management techniques that allow such systems to independently adapt the resources they use based upon their perception of individual resource reliability. Using our approach we were able to scale out the backend infrastructure of the Cloud service elastically (min 30thinspaces per worker), opportunistically and autonomically.

However, SLAs alone do not solve the issue entirely as there is no unique rule to create an SLA. They vary in description, length, and types of information released. Therefore, consumers need a better way of estimating 'trustworthiness' of a cloud (CSP). In this work we propose a framework to alleviate the above issue.

A cloud platform is often highly scalable and cost-effective through its pay-as-you-go pricing model. However, being shared by a large number of users, the running of applications in the platform faces higher performance uncertainty compared to a dedicated platform. Existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) cannot sufficiently address the performance variation issue. In this paper, we use utility theory leveraged from economics and develop a new utility model for measuring customer satisfaction in the cloud. Based on the utility model, we design a mechanism to support utility-based SLAs in order to balance the performance of applications and the cost of running them. We consider an infrastructure-as-a-service type cloud platform (e.g., Amazon EC2), where a business service provider leases virtual machine (VM) instances with spot prices from the cloud and gains revenue by serving its customers. Particularly, we investigate the interaction of service profit and customer satisfaction. In addition, we present two scheduling algorithms that can effectively bid for different types of VM instances to make tradeoffs between profit and customer satisfaction. We conduct extensive simulations based on the performance data of different types of Amazon EC2 instances and their price history.

Previous resource provisioning strategies either allocate physical resources to virtual machines (VMs) based on static VM resource demands or dynamically handle the variations in VM resource requirements through live VM migrations. However, the former fail to maximize energy efficiency and resource utilization while the latter produce high migration overhead. To handle these problems, we propose an initial VM allocation mechanism that consolidates complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness. Complementary VMs are the VMs whose total demand of each resource dimension (in the spatial space) nearly reaches their host's capacity during VM lifetime period (in the temporal space). Based on our observation of the existence of VM resource utilization patterns, the mechanism predicts the lifetime resource utilization patterns of short-term VMs or periodical resource utilization patterns of long-term VMs. Based on the predicted patterns, it coordinates the requirements of different resources and consolidates complementary VMs in the same physical machine (PM). This mechanism reduces the number of PMs needed to provide VM service hence increases energy efficiency and resource utilization and also reduces the number of VM migrations and SLA violations. Simulation based on two real traces and real-world testbed experiments show that our initial VM allocation mechanism significantly reduces the number of PMs used, SLA violations and VM migrations of the previous resource provisioning strategies.;;2014;Chen, Liuhua & Shen, Haiying;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6848033;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;208;Characterizing web application performance for maximizing service providers' profits in clouds;A number of challenges in implementing cloud technique related to further improving Web application performance and decreasing the cost.

By constructing the SLA-tree, we efficiently support the answering of certain profit-oriented ""what if"" questions.

Processes of these applications often comprise a series of services mapping to users' work flows and a consumer has to designate a particular provider for each service when deploying an application. As long as the provider fails to deliver the service, all application processes which include the service will discontinue their execution even though some other providers may offer the same service. In this paper, we propose a SaaS framework to support dynamic service composition based on QoS criteria of SLA. Each service is brokered and delivered to best fit the criteria specified when it is requested.

It is performed to ensure that security risks, governance controls and vulnerabilities are proactively managed through the lifecycle of the services, and to guarantee that all discovered problems and issues are addressed and remediated for quality assurance before the services are delivered to customers. The validation process is complex and is typically carried out by following a checklist with questions and answers through manual steps that are time consuming and error prone. This lengthy process is particularly troublesome when providing managed cloud services to enterprise customers with a pre-specified request fulfillment time in SLA. In order to improve the timeliness and quality of cloud services, we have introduced an automation system to orchestrate the validation process with executable scripts to be executed against the services.

While reserving the services in cloud we need to establish Service Level Agreements through negotiation. The negotiation between consumers and cloud Service providers will basically include parameters like price, time and Quality of Service(QoS). There are many existing approaches which solve the problem of price and time slot negotiation mechanism without taking into account the important aspect QoS. In our proposed work this can be solved by the Cloud Monitoring System(CMS) which enhances the QoS. Monitoring can be performed by a global predicate is defined as a conjunction of the local properties of different network elements. In the system if it contains N distributed network elements coordinated by a central monitoring station. Each network element monitors a set of local properties and the central station is responsible for identifying the status of global parameters registered in the system. After detecting the local changes, each network element has to emit alarms in order to ensure that global parameters are not violated.

Haizea is a popular cloud lease manager which supports a variety of resource leases according to the application requirements. These leases are: Immediate, Best-Effort, Deadline Sensitive and Advance Reservation (AR). But all these leases are static in nature viz. once resources are allocated to a lease, these resources cannot be altered during the complete lifetime of the lease. This contradicts with the philosophy and implementation of a pure on-demand elastic cloud where resources of a lease are continuously monitored against the utilization and altered based on the requirements. Our work aims at the inclusion of three important features to mitigate this shortcoming in Haizea. First, it introduces a new class of lease: Dynamic lease to accommodate resource changes. Second, it examines virtual machine resource utilization to decide about the demand and need of allocation change and third, it accommodates the expected changes in resource allocation by introducing two new sub-leases which allow dynamic resource allocation in the schedule.

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized load balancing architecture, called tldlb (two-level decentralized load balancer). This distributed load balancer takes advantage of the decentralized architecture for providing scalability and high availability capabilities to service more cloud users.

In nn-dwrr, we combine VM load metrics (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and disk I/O utilizations) monitoring and neural network-based load prediction to adjust the weight of each VM. Experimental results support that our proposed load balancing algorithm, nn-dwrr, can be applied to a large cloud datacenter, and it is 1.86 times faster than the wrr, 1.49 times faster than the Capacity-based, and 1.21 times faster than the ANN-based load balancing algorithms in terms of average response time.

This paper proposes a monitoring approach that automatically adapts the monitoring process in realtime, based on user-specified policies. The monitor can both adapt the frequency of measurements and monitoring mode: active and passive. Active mode uses an external, trusted monitoring service. Passive mode minimizes interaction with an external monitoring service, relying instead on a mutual commit protocol to ensure SLA compliance.

To analyze the behavior of a Cloud data center by means of various aspects like availability, utilization, responsiveness and waiting time.

Live migration of VMs, the process of dynamically transferring a virtual machine across different servers, hasproved to represent a new opportunity to enable responsive and dynamic proved torepresent a new opportunity toenable responsive and dynamic resource management in modern data centers. Migrations of VMs is performed on the basis of overloading that occurs in physical servers in cloud data centers, whichleads to relatively less performance degradation. The SLA violation is also less compared to other techniques and this means the cloud provider will incur less cost from VM migrations.

Because of raised expectations, several vendors, such as Amazon and IBM, started designing, developing, and deploying Cloud solutions to optimize the usage of their own data centers, and some open-source solutions are also underway, such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack. Cloud architectures exploit virtualization techniques to provision multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on the same physical host, so as to efficiently use available resources, for instance, to consolidate VMs in the minimal number of physical servers to reduce the runtime power consumption. VM consolidation has to carefully consider the aggregated resource consumption of co-located VMs, in order to avoid performance reductions and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. While various works have already treated the VM consolidation problem from a theoretical perspective, this paper focuses on it from a more practical viewpoint, with specific attention on the consolidation aspects related to power, CPU, and networking resource sharing. Moreover, the paper proposes a Cloud management platform to optimize VM consolidation along three main dimensions, namely power consumption, host resources, and networking.

The processing of the users request plays an important role in the cloud service. In order to achieve low response time of the requested user service, the services are processed as such resulting in low throughput where all the users can't receive their guaranteed service from the cloud provider. The random processing of service as a result, a security issue such as intrusion also occurs. The novel cloud scheduling scheme uses SLA(Service Level Agreement) along with trust monitor to provide a faster scheduling of the over flooding user request with secure processing of the request. The security of the cloud is maintain based on the SLA criteria and trust monitor acts as the third party and monitors whole processing of the services, any illegal action is consider as intrusion and reported to the scheduler and message is sent to the user and provider and further penalties is taken. The schedule gives improved fast schedule time and low rescheduling ratio than grid scheduling. The proposed schedule scheme provides advantages and better performance for both the cloud user and service provider.;;2011;Daniel, D. & Jeno Lovesum, S.P.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6024605;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;243;An availability model for eucalyptus platform: An analysis of warm-standy replication mechanism;High availability in cloud computing services is essential for maintaining customer confidence and avoiding revenue losses due to SLA violation penalties. Since the software and hardware components of cloud infrastructures may have limited reliability, fault tolerance mechanisms are a means of achieving the necessary dependability requirements. This paper investigates the benefits of a warm-standy replication mechanism in a Eucalyptus cloud computing environment. A hierarchical heterogeneous modeling approach is used to represent a redundant architecture and compare its availability to that of a non-redundant architecture. Both hardware and software failures are considered in the proposed analytical models. The results show an enhanced dependability for the proposed redundant system, as well as a decrease in the annual downtime. The results also demonstrate that the simple replacement of hardware by more reliable machines would not produce improvements in system availability to the same extent as would the fault tolerant approach.;;2012;"Dantas, Jamilson; Matos, Rubens; Araujo, Jean & Maciel, Paulo";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6377976;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;244;An intelligent approach for virtual machine and QoS provisioning in cloud computing;Cloud Computing has become the most popular distributed computing environment because it does not require any user level management and controlling on the low-level implementation of the system. However, efficient resource provisioning is a key challenge for cloud computing and resolving such kind of problem can reduce under or over utilization of resources, increase user satisfaction by serving more users during peak hours, reduce implementation cost for providers and service cost for users. Existing works on cloud computing focuses to accurate estimation of the capacity needs, static or dynamic VM (Virtual Machine) creation and scheduling. But significant amount of time is required to create and destroy VMs which could be used to serve more user requests. In this paper, an adaptive QoS (Quality of Service) aware VM provisioning mechanism is developed that ensures efficient utilization of the system resources. The VM for similar type of requests has been recycled so that the VM creation time can be minimized and used to serve more user requests. In the proposed model, QoS is ensured by serving all the tasks within the requirements described in SLA. Tasks are separated using multilevel queue and the most urgent task is given high priority. The simulation-based experimental results shows that a great number of tasks can be served compared to others which will help to satisfy customers during the peak hour.;;2013;"Das, A.

Security requirements are a basic necessity for all service models along with the essential need to satisfy compliance requirements. Moreover, compliance for each service model requires different specific protection for online data such as Accountability, Transparency, Accuracy, Security and Access. The main focus is to find new methods to manage risk factors and compliance violations in the cloud computing security, which the business or companies can utilize to manage processes and decision rights. This work is an extension to MEGHNAD [1,2] framework that uses a Muti-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) to find optimal security toolset which also satisfy compliance. It embeds the use of compressive research on different compliance model requirements against each service model along with offering the right combination of security tools for different cloud services and level of security assurance required. This framework can be used by companies to determine the tools and compliances they needs from cloud service providers. This will also provide the companies an estimate on the cost and insurance for the security tool and the compliance they select. The developed tool will generate a SLA document for the organization to help find the correct required services from the vendor in order to certify the compliance in their industry structure.;;;Dasgupta, Dipankar & Naseem, Durdana;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.372.1617;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;246;An Autonomous Reliability-Aware Negotiation Strategy for Cloud Computing Environments;;excluded;;Dastjerdi, Amiir Vahid & Buyya, Rajkumar;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.294.6440;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;247;Compatibility-Aware Cloud Service Composition under Fuzzy Preferences of Users;When a single Cloud service (i.e., a software image and a virtual machine), on its own, cannot satisfy all the user requirements, a composition of Cloud services is required. Cloud service composition, which includes several tasks such as discovery, compatibility checking, selection, and deployment, is a complex process and users find it difficult to select the best one among the hundreds, if not thousands, of possible compositions available. Service composition in Cloud raises even new challenges caused by diversity of users with different expertise requiring their applications to be deployed across difference geographical locations with distinct legal constraints. The main difficulty lies in selecting a combination of virtual appliances (software images) and infrastructure services that are compatible and satisfy a user with vague preferences. Therefore, we present a framework and algorithms which simplify Cloud service composition for unskilled users. We develop an ontology-based approach to analyze Cloud service compatibility by applying reasoning on the expert knowledge. In addition, to minimize effort of users in expressing their preferences, we apply combination of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic for composition optimization. This lets users express their needs in linguistics terms which brings a great comfort to them compared to systems that force users to assign exact weights for all preferences.;;2014;Dastjerdi, Amir Vahid & Buyya, Rajkumar;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6714436;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;248;An Autonomous Reliability-Aware Negotiation Strategy for Cloud Computing Environments;Cloud computing paradigm allows subscription-based access to computing and storages services over the Internet. Since with advances of Cloud technology, operations such as discovery, scaling, and monitoring are accomplished automatically, negotiation between Cloud service requesters and providers can be a bottleneck if it is carried out by humans. Therefore, our objective is to offer a state-of-the-art solution to automate the negotiation process in Cloud environments. In previous works in the SLA negotiation area, requesters trust whatever QoS criteria values providers offer in the process of negotiation. However, the proposed negotiation strategy for requesters in this work is capable of assessing reliability of offers received from Cloud providers. In addition, our proposed negotiation strategy for Cloud providers considers utilization of resources when it generates new offers during negotiation and concedes more on the price of less utilized resources. The experimental results show that our strategy helps Cloud providers to increase their profits when they are participating in parallel negotiation with multiple requesters.;;2012;Dastjerdi, Amir Vahid & Buyya, Rajkumar;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217433 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310187;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;249;QoS-aware Deployment of Network of Virtual Appliances Across Multiple Clouds;Cloud computing paradigm allows on-demand access to computing and storages services over the Internet. To solve the complexity of application deployment in Cloud infrastructure, virtual appliances, pre-configured, ready-to-run applications are emerging as a breakthrough technology. However, an automated approach for deploying network of appliances is required to guarantee minimum deployment cost, low latency, and high reliability. In this paper, we propose and compare two different deployment approaches: Forward-checking-based backtracking (FCBB) and genetic-based. They take into account Quality of Service (QoS) criteria such as reliability, data communication cost, and latency between multiple Clouds to choose the most appropriate combination of virtual machines and appliances. We evaluate our approach using a real case study and different request types. Experimental results show both algorithms reach near optimal solution.

The major motivations to adopt Cloud services include no upfront investment on infrastructure and transferring responsibility of maintenance, backups, and license management to Cloud Providers. However, one of the key challenges that holds businesses from adopting Cloud computing services is that, by migrating to Cloud, they move some of their information and services out of their direct control. Their main concern is how well the Cloud providers keep their information (security) and deliver their services (performance). To cope with this challenge, several service level agreement management systems have been proposed. However, monitoring service deployment as a major responsibility of those systems have not been deeply investigated yet. Therefore, this paper shows how monitoring services have to be described, deployed (discovered and ranked), and then how they have to be executed to enforce accurate penalties by eliminating service level agreement failure cascading effects on violation detection.

Standard approaches to modeling system behavior (by analyzing the totality of the observed data, such as regression based approaches) tend to predict average rather than exceptional system behavior and may ignore important patterns of change over time. Consequently, such approaches are of limited use in providing warnings of future peak utilization within a cloud environment. Skewing predictions to better fit peak utilizations, results in poor fitting to low utilizations, which compromises the ability to accurately predict peak utilizations, due to false positives. In this paper, we present an adaptive approach that estimates, at run time, the best prediction value based on the performance of the previously seen predictions. This algorithm has wide applicability. We applied this adaptive technique to two large-scale real world case studies.

Cloud security infrastructure should address two aspects of the IaaS operation and dynamic security services provisioning: (1) provide security infrastructure for secure Cloud IaaS operation, (2) provisioning dynamic security services, including creation and management of the dynamic security associations, as a part of the provisioned composite services or virtual infrastructures. The first task is a traditional task in security engineering, while dynamic provisioning of managed security services in virtualised environment remains a problem and requires additional research. In this paper we discuss both aspects of the Cloud Security and provide suggestions about required security mechanisms for secure data management in dynamically provisioned Cloud infrastructures. The paper refers to the architectural framework for on-demand infrastructure services provisioning, being developed by authors, that provides a basis for defining the proposed Cloud Security Infrastructure. The proposed SLA management solution is based on the WS-Agreement and allows dynamic SLA management during the whole provisioned services lifecycle. The paper discusses conceptual issues, basic requirements and practical suggestions for dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure (DACI). The paper proposes the security mechanisms that are required for consistent DACI operation, in particular security tokens used for access control, policy enforcement and authorisation session context exchange between provisioned infrastructure services and Cloud provider services.

We address the question, ""What is needed to make it possible for an entire value-network to take secure, collaborative business process executions to the cloud?"" Future value-network cloud solutions will require completely new security approaches that will leverage contracted brokering solutions operating as part of the cloud solution. We view value-network cloud security service provisioning as a bundle decision characterized by a mix of communication patterns relevant to intra- and inter-enterprise collaboration. We propose a cloud service broker model--using semantics and SLA based middleware--to serve as a trusted interface between the enterprise, cloud service providers and other organizations collaborating in a value-network.

Monitoring is crucial from two perspectives - the cloud-user and the service provider. The cloud user's interest is in doing an analysis to arrive at appropriate Service-level agreement (SLA) demands and thecloud provider's interest is to assess if the demand can be met. To support this, a monitoring framework is necessary particularly since cloud hosts are subject to varying load conditions. To illustrate the importance of such a framework, we choose the example of performance being the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement and show how inappropriate provisioning of resources may lead to unexpected performance bottlenecks. We evaluate existing monitoring frameworks to bring out the motivation for buildingmuch more powerful monitoring frameworks.

However, in current virtualized systems resource allocation is mostly static. Resources are allocated during VM instantiation and any change in workload leading to significant increase or decrease in resources is handled by VM migration. Hence, cloud users tend to characterize their workloads at a coarse grained level which potentially leads to under-utilized VM resources or under performing application. A more flexible and adaptive resource allocation mechanism would benefit variable workloads, such as those characterized by web servers. In this paper, we present an elastic resources framework for IaaS cloud layer that addresses this need. The framework provisions for application workload forecasting engine, that predicts at run-time the expected demand, which is input to the resource manager to modulate resource allocation based on the predicted demand. Based on the prediction errors, resources can be over-allocated or under-allocated as compared to the actual demand made by the application. Over-allocation leads to unused resources and under allocation could cause under performance. To strike a good trade-off between over-allocation and under-performance we derive an excess cost model. In this model excess resources allocated are captured as over-allocation cost and under-allocation is captured as a penalty cost for violating application service level agreement (SLA). Confidence interval for predicted workload is used to minimize this excess cost with minimal effect on SLA violations. An example case-study for an academic institute web server workload is presented. Using the confidence interval to minimize excess cost, we achieve significant reduction in resource allocation requirement while restricting application SLA violations to below 2-3\%.;;2013;"Dhingra, Mohit; Lakshmi, J.; Nandy, S.

Particularly, the non-reliance on stable storage devices simplifies dynamic resize of these platforms, which typically only involves setting up (or shutting down) some data-cache instance. On the other hand, defining the well suited amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the degree of replication of slices of data, in order to optimize reliability/availability and performance tradeoffs, is far from being a trivial task. As a example, scaling up/down the size of the underlying infrastructure might give rise to scarcely predictable secondary effects on the side of the synchronization protocol adopted to guarantee data consistency while supporting transactional accesses. In this paper we investigate on the usage of machine learning approaches with the aim at providing a means for automatically tuning the data grid configuration, which is achieved via dynamic selection of both the well suited amount of cache servers, and the well suited degree of replication of the data-objects. The final target is to determine configurations that are able to guarantee specific throughput or latency values (such as those established by some SLA), under some specific workload profile/intensity, while minimizing at the same time the cost for the cloud infrastructure.

As the use of PaaS becomes pervasive, defining and maintaining SLAs (Service Level Agreements) between PaaS customers and providers becomes essential. Useful SLAs should provide guarantees on application quality properties (e.g., response time) rather than on resource availability (e.g., number of virtual machines). Current PaaS offerings either provide no support for providing such guarantees or provide support targeting a restricted set of application types. In this paper, we present an SLA-driven PaaS architecture, called Meryn, which supports cloud bursting and is designed to be easily extensible to host new application types. We propose a decentralized optimization policy aiming at maximizing the PaaS provider profit and taking into account the payment of penalties incurred when quality guarantees are unsatisfied. In addition, we apply the proposed optimization policy to batch and MapReduce applications. We implemented and evaluated our policy through a series of simulations on the Grid5000 test bed.

One of the key techniques used for the efficient use of cloud server resources is virtual machine placement. This work introduces a precise VM placement algorithm that ensures energy efficiency and also prevents Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. The mathematical model of the algorithm is supported by a sophisticated data analytic system implemented as a service. The precision of the algorithm is achieved by allowing each individual VM to build its own data model on demand over an appropriate time horizon. Thus the data model can reflect accurately the characteristics of resource usage of the VM.

Owing to the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on trust attributes is necessary to enforce service-level agreements. This study presents Cloud-Trust, an adaptive trust management model for efficiently evaluating the competence of a cloud service based on its multiple trust attributes. In Cloud-Trust, two kinds of adaptive modelling tools (rough set and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator) are organically integrated and successfully applied to trust data mining and knowledge discovery. Using rough set to discover knowledge from trust attributes makes the model surpass the limitations of traditional models, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Moreover, Cloud-Trust uses the IOWA operator to aggregate the global trust degree based on time series, thereby enabling better real-time performance. Experimental results show that Cloud-Trust converges more rapidly and accurately than do existing approaches, thereby verifying that it can effectively take on trust measurement tasks in cloud computing.;;2013;Du, Junping & Li, Xiaoyong;http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0232;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;271;SUITS: How to make a global IT service provider sustainable?;IT Service Providers are faced with the challenge to reconcile their goals in providing services efficiently and with the quality of services required while sustaining the environment. With the introduction of carbon taxation and regulations to control green gas emissions, there is a need to expand service design to incorporate heterogeneity in carbon taxes due to regional differences. The service providers have flexibility of selecting best locations for delivery of a service by taking into consideration operational cost associated with green gas emissions. They can also buy or sell carbon credits in a carbon trading market to maintain sustainable operational performance. In this paper, we introduce the Sustainable IT Services (SUITS) framework to develop models for operational performance of an IT Service Provider in a global environment with carbon taxation and carbon credit trading markets. The models are used to formulate a revenue optimization problem for the IT Service Provider in this environment.

At the same time users' and operators' requirements become more and more complex. However, existing data centre frameworks do not typically take energy consumption into account as a key parameter of the data centre's configuration. To lower the power consumption while fulfilling performance requirements we propose a flexible and energy-aware framework for the (re)allocation of virtual machines in a data centre. The framework, being independent from the data centre management system, computes and enacts the best possible placement of virtual machines based on constraints expressed through service level agreements. The framework's flexibility is achieved by decoupling the expressed constraints from the algorithms using the Constraint Programming (CP) paradigm and programming language, basing ourselves on a cluster management library called Entropy.

When deploying distributed applications into a mobile ad hoc cloud, the locality of application participants that communicate with each other can affect latency, power/-battery usage, throughput, and whether or not a cloud provider can meet service-level agreements (SLA). Optimization of important communication links within a distributed application is particularly important when dealing with mission-critical applications deployed in a distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) scenario, where violation of SLAs may result in loss of property, cyber infrastructure, or lives. To complicate the optimization process, the underlying cloud environment can change during operation and an optimal deployment of the distributed application may degrade over time due to hardware failures, overloaded hosts, and other issues that are beyond the control of distributed application developers. To optimize performance of distributed applications in dynamic environments, therefore, the deployment of participants may need adapting and revising according to the requirements of application developers and the resources available in the underlying cloud environment. This paper present two contributions to the study of dynamic optimizations of user-provided deployments within a cloud. First, we present a dataflow description language that allows developers to designate key communication paths between participants within their distributed applications.

For each class, the SLA is specified by the request rejection probabilities of the clients in that class. The proposed solution supports cloud service providers in the decision making about 1) defining realistic SLAs, 2) the dimensioning of data centers, 3) whether to accept new clients, and 4) the amount of resources to be reserved for high priority clients.

When such a platform is built on an elastic pay-per-use infrastructure, an added challenge is to minimize the system's operating cost while guaranteeing the tenants' service level agreements (SLA). Elastic load balancing is therefore an important feature to enable scale-up during high load while scaling down when the load is low. Live migration, a technique to migrate tenants with minimal service interruption and no downtime, is critical to allow lightweight elastic scaling. We focus on the problem of live migration in the database layer. We propose Zephyr, a technique to efficiently migrate a live database in a shared nothing transactional database architecture. Zephyr uses phases of on-demand pull and asynchronous push of data, requires minimal synchronization, results no service unavailability and few or no aborted transactions, minimizes the data transfer overhead, provides ACID guarantees during migration, and ensures correctness in the presence of failures. We outline a prototype implementation using an open source relational database engine and an present a thorough evaluation using various transactional workloads.

This infrastructure also makes it possible for a data center to extend its total capacity by subcontracting additional resources from collaborating data centers, making the infrastructure a federation of Clouds. For accounting and billing, such infrastructures call for novel approaches to perform accounting for capacity that varies over time and for services (or more precisely virtual machines) that migrate between physical machines or even between data centers. For billing, needs arise for new approaches to simultaneously manage postpaid and prepaid payment schemes for capacity that varies over time in response to user needs. In this paper, we outline usage scenarios and a set of requirements for such infrastructures, and propose an accounting and billing architecture to be used within RESERVOIR.

The correct provisioning of resources is a difficult task due to variations and uncertainty in workload demands. Most data center workload demands are very spiky in nature and often vary significantly during the course of a single day. Because the resource availability in a data center is generally unpredictable due to the shared feature of the cloud resources and because of the stochastic nature of the workload, severe service level agreement (SLA) violations may occur frequently. To overcome this problem, researcher's attention is diverted towards developing dynamic resource management strategies. In this paper, an autonomic resource controller is proposed that dynamically controls the resource allocation for data center's virtual containers. The controller has two parts: A resource modeler that models the non-linearity of the system by employing different Machine Learning techniques allowing the datacenter to allocate the appropriate resources and a resource fuzzy tuner that dynamically tunes the allocated resources using fuzzy logic to sustain the desired performance taking into consideration the enforcing of service differentiation among clients. Experimental results on a real data center dataset showed that the proposed resource controller can predict future resource needs while still sustaining performance goals stated in the SLA. Also, using the bagging and the boosting techniques along with model tree classifiers was demonstrated to be promising in terms of accuracy and performance.;;2013;Elprince, N.;;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;282;Self-Manageable Cloud Service Provisioning Infrastructure: SLA Enforcement via Holistic Monitoring Techniques and Novel Application Scheduling Mechanism;This book presents exceptional monitoring techniques for the management of service provisioning in Cloud Computing and the enforcement of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in an autonomic manner.

Service provisioning in Clouds is based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) representing a contract signed between the customer and the service provider stating the terms of the agreement including non-functional requirements of the service specified as Quality of Service (QoS), obligations, and penalties in case of agreement violations. On the one hand SLA violation should be prevented to avoid costly penalties and on the other hand providers have to efficiently utilize resources to minimize cost for the service provisioning. Thus, scheduling strategies considering multiple SLA parameters and efficient allocation of resources are necessary. Recent work considers various strategies with single SLA parameters. However, those approaches are limited to simple workflows and single task applications. Scheduling and deploying service requests considering multiple SLA parameters such as amount of CPU required, network bandwidth, memory and storage are still open research challenges.

In order to avoid costly SLA violations and to timely react to failures and environmental changes, advanced SLA enactment strategies are necessary, which include appropriate resource-monitoring concepts. Currently, Cloud providers tend to adopt existing monitoring tools, as for example those from Grid environments. However, those tools are usually restricted to locality and homogeneity of monitored objects, are not scalable, and do not support mapping of low-level resource metrics e.g., system up and down time to high-level application specific SLA parameters e.g., system availability. In this paper we present a novel framework for managing the mappings of the Low-level resource Metrics to High-level SLAs (LoM2HiS framework). The LoM2HiS framework is embedded into FoSII infrastructure, which facilitates autonomic SLA management and enforcement. Thus, the LoM2HiS framework detects future SLA violation threats and can notify the enactor component to act so as to avert the threats.

Although, there is a large body of work in the area of SLA provisioning and monitoring at infrastructure and platform layers, SLAs are usually assumed to be guaranteed at the application layer. However, application monitoring is a challenging task due to monitored metrics of the platform or infrastructure layer that cannot be easily mapped to the required metrics at the application layer. Sophisticated SLA monitoring among those layers to avoid costly SLA penalties and maximize the provider profit is still an open research challenge.

Thus, adequate SLA monitoring strategies and timely detection of possible SLA violations represent challenging research issues. This paper presents the Detecting SLA Violation infrastructure (DeSVi) architecture, sensing SLA violations through sophisticated resource monitoring. Based on the user requests, DeSVi allocates computing resources for a requested service and arranges its deployment on a virtualized environment. Resources are monitored using a novel framework capable of mapping low-level resource metrics (e.g., host up and down time) to user-defined SLAs (e.g., service availability). The detection of possible SLA violations relies on the predefined service level objectives and utilization of knowledge databases to manage and prevent such violations. We evaluate the DeSVi architecture using two application scenarios: (i) image rendering applications based on ray-tracing, and (ii) transactional web applications based on the well-known TPC-W benchmark. These applications exhibit heterogeneous workloads for investigating optimal monitoring interval of SLA parameters.

It acts as a torchbearer technology for realising a new computing model in which resources can be acquired and released on demand. However, a fundamental issue in the instantiation of resources is how to afford optimal allocation so that the service provider fulfils the users’ service level agreement while minimising its operational cost and maximising its revenue. In this paper, we tackle the problem of networking static service provisioning within the Cloud’s private backbone network. This requires the embedding of virtual networks in which edge routers are directly connected to data centres. Our objective is to map online virtual networks in the private substrate backbone network using the minimum physical resources but while still satisfying the required QoS in terms of bandwidth, processing power and memory. This in turn minimises the reject rate of requests and maximises returns for the substrate network provider. Since the virtual network embedding problem is NP-hard, we propound a new scalable embedding strategy named VNE-AC to deal with its computational hardness. This is based on the Ant Colony metaheuristic. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performances of our proposal.

This provision is governed by a mutual contract known as Service Level Agreement (SLA), to which both clients and providers are confined. Monitoring activities should be undertaken to guarantee the pre-agreed SLA. However, monitoring multiple SLA in a federated Cloud depends highly on the collaboration among Cloud providers participating in satisfying a client service request, which makes it very challenging and complex. Monitoring linked SLAs requires a consistent specification of SLA parameters, dynamic SLA negotiation, and multi-level SLAs monitoring, in addition to a reliable enforcement measures. In this paper, we extend SLA specification to cope with the specificity of federation and its constraints. We also, propose a monitoring model that handles the complexity of managing a Multi-level monitoring and propose a solution to mitigate the cascading effect due to SLAs monitoring.

However, its best effort delivery approach is ill-suited to guarantee the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of many existing multimedia services, which results in a significant reduction of the Quality of Experience. This paper presents a solution to these problems, in the form of a framework for dynamically setting up federations between the stakeholders involved in the content delivery chain. More specifically, the framework provides an automated mechanism to set up end-to-end delivery paths from the content provider to the access Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which act as its direct customers and represent a group of end-users. Driven by Service Level Agreements (SLAs), QoS contracts are automatically negotiated between the content provider, the access ISPs, and the intermediary network domains along the delivery paths. These contracts capture the delivered QoS and resource reservation costs, which are subsequently used in the price negotiations between content provider and access ISPs. Additionally, it supports the inclusion of cloud providers within the federations, supporting on-the-fly allocation of computational and storage resources. This allows the automatic deployment and configuration of proxy caches along the delivery paths, which potentially reduce delivery costs and increase delivered quality.;;2012;"Famaey, J.; Latre, S.; Wauters, T. & De Turck, F.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6212058;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;296;A novel trust management framework for multi-cloud environments based on trust service providers;In this paper, we address the problem of trust management in multi-cloud environments based on a set of distributed Trust Service Providers (TSPs). These are independent third-party providers/trust agents, trusted by Cloud Providers (CPs), Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Cloud Service Users (CSUs), that provide trust related services to cloud participants. TSPs are distributed over the clouds, and they elicit raw trust evidence from different sources and in different formats. This evidence is information regarding the adherence of a CSP to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for a cloud-based service and the feedback sent by CSUs. Using this information, they evaluate an objective trust and a subjective trust of CSPs. TSPs communicate among themselves through a trust propagation network that permits a TSP to obtain trust information about a CSP from other TSPs. Experiments show that our proposed framework is effective and relatively stable in differentiating trustworthy and untrustworthy CSPs in a multi-cloud environment.;;2014;Fan, Wenjuan & Perros, Harry;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705114002755;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;297;Simulated-Annealing Load Balancing for Resource Allocation in Cloud Environments;Recently, the development of cloud computing has received considerable attention. For cloud service providers, packing VMs onto a small number of servers is an effective way to reduce energy costs, so as to improve the efficiency of the data center. However allocating too many VMs on a physical machine may cause some hot spots which violate the SLA of applications. Load balancing of the entire system is hence needed to guarantee the SLA. In this paper, we present a simulated-annealing load balancing algorithm for solving the resource allocation and scheduling problem in a cloud computing environment.

In the cloud computing model, providers are required to continuously meet their SLA claims in the face of unanticipated failure of cloud resources. The dynamics of the cloud environment as attributed to its unpredictable mode of use and elasticity of its resources make human-driven solutions inefficient or sometimes infeasible. On the other hand, self-managed architectures have increasingly matured in their capacity to coordinate environments predominated by uncertainties. Thus making them a right fit for managing cloud-based systems. However, given the massive resource pool of the cloud, state-of-the-art centralised self-managed architectures are not scalable and are inherently brittle. Therefore, we propose a decentralised resource control mechanism which meets the unique robustness, scalability and resilience requirements of the cloud. The design of the mechanism gains inspiration from market control theory and a novel use of reputation metrics. In addition, an innovative self-managed cloud architecture has been designed based on the control mechanism.

Service terms are typically defined in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) binding both service providers and users. For the service user, there is a need to ensure that s/he is enjoying the agreed level of service and any violations are reported accordingly. For the service provider, there is a need to manage a resilient infrastructure capable of meeting SLA terms and inform strategies for maximising profit and resource utilisation. The massive size, dynamism and unpredictability of Cloud architectures makes these goals difficult to accomplish using classic Service Level Management (SLM) approaches. In this paper, we motivate the need for novel dynamic and decentralised approaches for the design of SLM. Requirements and key design decisions for the new SLM are described.

Therefore, users of cloud resources are embracing the more promising cloud federation model to ensure service guarantees. Here, users have the option of selecting between multiple cloud providers and subsequently switching to a more reliable one in the event of a provider's inability to meet its SLA.

However, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) is essential for maintaining reliable quality of service between data centers and their users in the cloud environment. Therefore, reduction of the SLA violation level and power costs are considered as two objectives in this paper. We present a CPU usage prediction method based on the linear regression technique. The proposed approach approximates the short-time future CPU utilization based on the history of usage in each host. It is employed in the live migration process to predict over-loaded and under-loaded hosts. When a host becomes over-loaded, some VMs migrate to other hosts to avoid SLA violation. Moreover, first all VMs migrate from a host while it becomes under-loaded. Then, the host switches to the sleep mode for reducing power consumption.

The diversity and usage benefits of the IaaS offers are encouraging SaaS providers to lease resources from the Cloud instead of operating their own data centers. This helps them to get rid of the maintenance overheads and better satisfy their customers which are more demanding in terms of service requirements nowadays. Such evolutionary tendency is leading to the emergence of new ways of service provisioning in which relying on infrastructure services of a single Cloud provider is not sufficient. Namely, the need of using Cloud services from multiple Clouds with various quality attributes and pricing models has been raised recently. Although service allocation based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) has been well investigated in Cloud computing so far, the new upcoming issues regarding to utilize multiple Clouds has led to new challenges. This paper looks at the service selection and allocation in a Multi-Cloud, as a delivery model of multiple Clouds, from the perspective of SaaS provider. The proposed framework assists SaaS providers to find suitable infrastructure services which best satisfy their requirements while handling SLA issues.

However, it is challenging for Cloud providers to allocate the pooled computing resources dynamically among the differentiated customers so as to maximize their revenue. It is not an easy task to transform the customer-oriented service metrics into operating level metrics, and control the Cloud resources adaptively based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the provider's revenue through SLA-based dynamic resource allocation as SLA plays a vital role in Cloud computing to bridge service providers and customers. We formalize the resource allocation problem using Queuing Theory and propose optimal solutions for the problem considering various Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as pricing mechanisms, arrival rates, service rates and available resources.

Typically, an application can be hosted in an execution platform constructed out of (real and virtual) cloud resources. In this context, the application QoS requirements can be specified in a SLA that binds the application to its hosting platform. Our architecture incorporates a load balancer that distributes the computational load across the platform resources, and monitors the QoS the platform delivers. If this deviates from that specified in the SLA, so as to violate it, the platform is reconfigured dynamically in order to incorporate additional resources from the cloud. In contrast, if the SLA is honored and platform resources result unused, platform reconfiguration occurs to release those unused resources.;;2010;"Ferretti, Stefano; Ghini, Vittorio; Panzieri, Fabio; Pellegrini, Michele & Turrini, Elisa";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1844768.1845354 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5557978;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;309;An intrusion detection framework for supporting SLA assessment in Cloud Computing;Cloud Computing is the emerging paradigm in distributed environment.

Due to the attraction of cloud computing, it has attracted several service providers to the market in a very time. These cloud service providers have created a very competitive market for the customers to choose from. Due to the heavy competition, the cost of cloud services must be kept at a minimum in order to attract the sufficient number of customers. Also on the other hand, the service providers must assign as many customers as possible to a single physical system, so that the investment on these systems becomes profitable. When many customers are assigned to a single physical system, the Quality of services (QoS) of the cloud offerings would suffer. Hence it becomes necessary to monitor, track and quantify the QoS of the cloud systems in order to provide the right information to both customers and service providers. This information would help both customers and service providers in terms creating a match between them based on expectations and the capacity to meet them. This would increase the efficiency of the cloud systems by loading them to the optimum levels without sacrificing on the expected quality. Continuous monitoring would help to understand the behavior of the system in the short term and long term helping the service providers to take the necessary remedial actions soon.

Trust computing systems can be employed for identifying the service providers quality in terms of their adherence to the committed in SLAs. Several trust computing mechanisms have been proposed in literature based on various algorithms and functions. Almost all of them are based on a single performance parameter and modify the trust scores monotonously when performance deviations are reported. This paper proposes a trust computing mechanism that statistically validates the attribute monitored before modifying the trust scores. Hence the proposed mechanism is protected from momentary fluctuations in system performances.

However, customers that are attracted to these DaaS alternatives may find that the range of different services and pricing options available to them add an unexpected level of complexity to their decision making. Cloud service pricing models are typically ‘pay-as-you-go' in which the customer is charged based on resource usage such as CPU and memory utilization. Thus, customers considering different DaaS options must take into account how the performance and efficiency of the DaaS will ultimately impact their monthly bill. In this paper, we show that the current DaaS model can produce unpleasant surprises --- for example, the case study that we present in this paper illustrates a scenario in which a DaaS service powered by a DBMS that has a lower hourly rate actually costs more to the end user than a DaaS service that is powered by another DBMS that charges a higher hourly rate. Thus, what we need is a method for the end-user to get an accurate estimate of the true costs that will be incurred without worrying about the nuances of how the DaaS operates. One potential solution to this problem is for DaaS providers to offer a new service called Benchmark as a Service (BaaS) where in the user provides the parameters of their workload and SLA requirements, and get a price quote.;;;"Floratou, Avrilia; Patel, Jignesh M.; Lang, Willis & Halverson, Alan";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.362.4276;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;316;The right tool for the job: Switching data centre management strategies at runtime;Applications are shifting into large scale, virtualized data centres that provide resources on a pay-per-usage basis.

To meet highly variable application demands, a dynamic approach to virtual machine (VM) management is required. This involves three basic management operations: (i) placing newly arrived VMs, (ii) migrating (moving) VMs off of highly utilized machines to avoid performance degradation, and (iii) migrating VMs off of underutilized machines so that they may be shut down to save power. We define a management strategy to consist of a set of policies that guide these three operations. We consider the goals of minimizing Service Level Agreement violations and minimizing power consumption. Developing a management strategy to achieve both of these goals is challenging, as the goals are often in conflict. We propose achieving both goals through dynamically switching between two management strategies, each with a single goal, depending on current data centre state. We propose three methods of dynamically switching strategies, and evaluate these methods through simulation.

SLAs specify the Quality of Service (QoS) that should be provided to customers as well as the billing model. A main concern for cloud service providers is to maintain the agreed SLA terms in order to avoid losses and penalties. Maintaining the SLA in turn requires translating the QoS to configurations of low-level mechanisms, able to enforce the agreed terms. Current systems provide no integrated support for SLA specification, translation, and enforcement. In this paper, we propose an approach for specifying and enforcing SLAs for cloud service providers. The approach covers the creation of SLA templates under a billing model, the design of performance and fault-tolerance QoS assurance mechanisms as well as the translation of QoS to appropriate configurations of those mechanisms. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using the Qu4DS framework for PaaS cloud providers. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of failures on the provider profit.

Cloud services are monitored and based on the resource utilization and performance load, they get scaled up or down, by provision or de-provision of cloud resources. The goal is to guarantee the customers an acceptable performance with a minimum of resources. Such Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics are stated in a contract, called Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiated between customer and provider. The approach of this paper shows that with additional imprecise information (e.g. expected daytime/week- time performance) modeled with fuzzy logic and used in a behavior, load and performance prediction model, the up and down scaling mechanism of a cloud service can be optimized.

However, it remains a great challenge for cluster deduplication to strike a sensible tradeoff between the conflicting goals of scalable deduplication throughput and high duplicate elimination ratio in cluster systems with low-end individual secondary storage nodes. We propose _-Dedupe, a scalable inline cluster deduplication framework, as a middleware deployable in cloud data centers, to meet this challenge by exploiting data similarity and locality to optimize cluster deduplication in inter-node and intra-node scenarios, respectively. Governed by a similarity-based stateful data routing scheme, _-Dedupe assigns similar data to the same backup server at the super-chunk granularity using a handprinting technique to maintain high cluster-deduplication efficiency without cross-node deduplication, and balances the workload of servers from backup clients. Meanwhile, _-Dedupe builds a similarity index over the traditional locality-preserved caching design to alleviate the chunk index-lookup bottleneck in each node. Extensive evaluation of our _-Dedupe prototype against state-of-the-art schemes, driven by real-world datasets, demonstrates that _-Dedupe achieves a cluster-wide duplicate elimination ratio almost as high as the high-overhead and poorly scalable traditional stateful routing scheme but at an overhead only slightly higher than that of the scalable but low duplicate-elimination-ratio stateless routing approaches.;;2012;"Fu, Yinjin; Jiang, Hong & Xiao, Nong";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2442626.2442649;Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;326;Proposed cloud architecture for automated & reliable service provisioning of engineering educational domain;Cloud Computing is an emerged technology of the domain High Performance Computing and serves the community for getting their services executed over the internet.

The novelty of the proposed scheme is to integrate timing analysis, queuing theory, integer programming, and control theory techniques.

In this large-scale, heterogeneous, multi-user environment of a cloud system, profit maximization for the cloud service provider (CSP) is a key objective. In this paper, the problem of global optimization of the cloud system operation (in the sense of lowering operation costs by maximizing energy efficiency, while satisfying user deadlines defined in the Service Level Agreements) is addressed from the perspective of the CSP. The modeling of the workload dictates viable approaches toward cloud operation optimization. Of the two current models: independent batch requests and task graphs with dependencies, we adopt the later. This fine-grained treatment of workloads provides many opportunities for energy and performance optimizations, thus enabling the CSP to meet user deadlines at lower operation costs. However, these optimizations require additional efforts in terms of resource provisioning, virtual machine placement, and task scheduling. Such issues are addressed in a holistic fashion in the proposed framework. In this cloud environment, users can construct their own services and applications based on the available set of virtual machines, but are relieved from the burden of resource provisioning and task scheduling. The CSP will then capitalize on the data parallelisms in each user workload, effectively manage the collective user requests, and apply custom optimizations to create a global energy cost and deadline-aware cloud platform.;;;"Gao, Yue; Wang, Yanzhi; Gupta, Sandeep K. & Pedram, Massoud";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.408.1618;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;334;SLA-driven dynamic cloud resource management;As the size and complexity of Cloud systems increase, the manual management of these solutions becomes a challenging issue as more personnel, resources and expertise are needed.

Over three million laser pulses were directed at the Earth by the SLA system during its _ 80 hours of nadir-pointing operation at an orbital altitude of 305 km (+/- 10 km). Approximately 90\% of these pulses resulted in valid range measurements to ocean, land, and cloud features. Of those which were fired at land targets, 57\% resulted in valid surface ranges, the remainder being cloud tops, false alarms, or missed shots. The SLA incorporated an electronic echo-recovery system into a pulsed, time-of-flight laser altimeter instrument in order to capture and characterize the vertical structure within each 100 m diameter surface footprint. The echoes recorded by SLA demonstrate aspects of the vertical structure of the nearly ubiquitous vegetation cover on the planet, as well as sensitivity to local slopes, surface reflectivity, and vertical ruggedness. With a vertical resolution of 0.75 m and horizontal sampling at 0.7 km length scales, SLA provides a new form of high vertical accuracy topographic data for studying problems related to the dynamics of the Earth's surface. Assessment of the error budget associated with the SLA experiment suggests that _2.8 m (RMS) precision was achieved for ranging measurements to oceanic surfaces, for which there are over 700,000 examples. With the availability of a precision radial orbit and post-flight Shuttleattitude information, a mid-latitude (+ 28.5° to _28.5°), georeferenced database of topographic ground control point elevations has been achieved using SLA data, consisting of _ 344,000 land measurements. Each of these measurements is geolocated to within 1–2 SLA footprints (100–200 m) on the Earth's surface, with vertical errors that approach the limits of resolution (0.75 m) of the instrument in topographically benign regions. When compared to available Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) with stated vertical accuracies on the order of 10–16 m, SLA's measurements differ by no more than 11 m to 46 m RMS in rugged terrain. We have computed a total vertical roughness parameter for all multi-peaked SLA echoes using a multi-Gaussian decomposition technique and have observed a very high degree of correlation of this parameter with global landcover classes. In some cases (_6\%), SLA echoes clearly resolve both the ground surface and vegetation canopy within a single footprint, suggesting that the modal height of equatorial vegetation is _ 18 m. The global distribution of total vertical roughness varies from _ 5 m to 60 m, with a mean value of 27 m and a standard deviation of 12 m.

Customers can make use of the cloud as a software (SaaS), platform (PaaS), or infrastructure (IaaS) provider. When one customer utilizes an environment provided by a SaaS cloud, she is unaware of any details about the computational infrastructure where her requests are being processed. Therefore, such infrastructure can be composed of computational resources from a datacenter owned by the SaaS or its resources can be leased from a cloud infrastructure provider.

These services leverage deduplication to reduce the disk storage capacity required by their customer data sets, but they usually re-duplicate the data when moving it from disk to tape.Deduplication does not add significant I/O overhead when performed on disk storage pools. However, when deduplicated data is naively placed on tape storage, the high degree of data fragmentation caused by deduplication--combined with the high seek and mount times of today's tape technology--leads to high retrieval times. This negatively impacts the recovery time objectives (RTO) that the service provider has to meet as a part of the service level agreement (SLA).This work proposes CloudDT, an extension to Cloud backup and archival services to efficiently support deduplication on tape pools. This paper (i) details the main challenges to enable efficient deduplication on tape libraries, (ii) introduces a class of solutions based on graph-modeling of similarity between data items that enables efficient placement on tapes, and (iii) presents the design and initial evaluation of algorithms that alleviate tape mount time overhead and reduce on-tape data fragmentation.Using 4.5 TB of real-world workloads, our initial evaluations show that our algorithms retain at least 95% of the deduplication storage efficiency, and offer up-to 40% faster restore performance compared to the case of restoring non-deduplicated data. Therefore, our techniques allow the backup service provider to increase tape resource utilization using deduplication, while also improving the restore time performance for the end-user.";;2012;"Gharaibeh, Abdullah; Constantinescu, Cornel; Lu, Maohua; Sharma, Anurag; Routray, Ramani R.; Sarkar, Prasenjit; Pease, David & Ripeanu, Matei";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2499406.2499429;International Federation for Information Processing;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;349;Energy-efficient resource management of cloud datacenters under fault tolerance constraints;The cloud computing as a ubiquitous paradigm could provide different services for internet users and Information Technology (IT) companies through datacenters that located around the world. However, cloud provider faces several problems such as high energy consumption and fault occurrence issues in cloud datacenters. Hence, cloud provider has to make a trade-off between energy and fault to gain more profit. In this paper, a migration method for the virtual machines to handle fault problem and prevent Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation is proposed by considering energy consumption constraints. The approach considers the lowest increasing in energy consumption and the minimal deadline miss ratio as the most significant factors for migration of each Virtual Machine (VM). The results show that low SLA violation is achieved with the least amount of energy consumption compared to other methods. It is also shown that the energy increasing by migration has an exponential relationship with the failure rate increasing.;;2013;Ghoreyshi, Seyed Mohammad;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6604493;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;350;An approach to identify and monitor SLA parameters for storage-as-a-service cloud delivery model;Cloud computing is an emerging technological paradigm that follows pay-as-you-use model. By this model, the consumers are charged according to the usage without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. Usually cloud services are offered as various delivery models among which Storage-as-a-Service cloud is gaining interest in recent time. In this model, raw (block) storage is offered as a service. Like any other utility services, cloud negotiates its service levels and guarantees with its consumers by establishing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLA is important in any provider-consumer interaction as it defines a formal basis for performance and availability the provider guarantees to deliver. It consists of a set of measurable attributes called SLA parameters which are established by some objectively measurable conditions, termed as Service Level Objectives (SLOs). However, the SLAs provided by the present day state-of-the-art clouds are relatively biased towards vendors and do not provide any formal method of verifying if the guarantees are complying or not.

However, service level agreements (SLAs), which document guaranteed quality of service levels, have not been found to be consistent among providers, even though they offer services with similar functionality. In service outsourcing environments, like cloud, the quality of service levels are of prime importance to customers, as they use third-party cloud services to store and process their clients’ data. If loss of data occurs due to an outage, the customer’s business gets affected. Therefore, the major challenge for a customer is to select an appropriate service provider to ensure guaranteed service quality. To support customers in reliably identifying ideal service provider, this work proposes a framework, SelCSP, which combines trustworthiness and competence to estimate risk of interaction. Trustworthiness is computed from personal experiences gained through direct interactions or from feedbacks related to reputations of vendors. Competence is assessed based on transparency in provider’s SLA guarantees. A case study has been presented to demonstrate the application of our approach.

Such failures may lead to occasional system downtime and eventual violation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) on the cloud service availability. The availability analysis of the underlying infrastructure is useful to the service provider to design a system capable of providing a defined SLA, as well as to evaluate the capabilities of an existing one. This paper presents a scalable, stochastic model-driven approach to quantify the availability of a large-scale IaaS cloud, where failures are typically dealt with through migration of physical machines among three pools: hot (running), warm (turned on, but not ready), and cold (turned off). Since monolithic models do not scale for large systems, we use an interacting Markov chain based approach to demonstrate the reduction in the complexity of analysis and the solution time. The three pools are modeled by interacting sub-models. Dependencies among them are resolved using fixed-point iteration, for which existence of a solution is proved. The analytic-numeric solutions obtained from the proposed approach and from the monolithic model are compared. We show that the errors introduced by interacting sub-models are insignificant and that our approach can handle very large size IaaS clouds.

However, these static collaborations pose certain challenges in the long run, which arise due to the changes in quality of resources and provider capabilities. In such a scenario, there is a need to dynamically establish appropriate collaborations so as to back-fill the resource quality and overcome shortfalls in provider capabilities. Our paper puts forth a mathematical model for cloud provider capabilities along with an approach to establish dynamic cloud provider collaborations. In our approach, once the under functioning resource is identified, we are able to find the most suitable replacement resource from within the same cloud provider or if need be, establish a new collaboration with another provider based on the required resource capabilities. This choice for new collaboration is based on the tenancy requirements, current state of resource utilization and capacity, and health of the specific resource to be replaced.

Utility computing, reliable data storage, and infrastructure-independent computing are example applications of such systems. Operational cost in these systems is highly dependent on the resource management algorithms used to assign virtual machines (VMs) to physical servers and possibly migrate them in case of power and thermal emergencies. Energy non-proportionality of IT devices in a datacenter, cooling system inefficiency, and power delivery network constraints should be considered by the resource management algorithms in order to minimize the energy cost as much as possible. Scalability of the resource assignment solution is one of the biggest concerns in designing these algorithms. This thesis examines the resource management problem in datacenters. First a centralized datacenter resource management is proposed, which considers service level agreements (SLAs) in VM placement in order to minimize the total operational cost of the datacenter. Second, a hierarchical SLA-based resource management structure is proposed, which considers the peak power constraints and cooling-related power consumption in addition to the scalability issue. The proposed hierarchical structure fits the hierarchical resource distribution in datacenters. The proposed structure is suitable to track and react to dynamic changes inside the datacenter to satisfy SLA constraints and avoid emergencies. Third, a load balancing algorithm to minimize the operational cost of a multi-datacenter cloud system is presented.

Electrical energy cost of a cloud computing system is a strong function of the consolidation and migration techniques used to assign incoming clients to existing servers. Moreover, each client typically has a service level agreement (SLA), which specifies constraints on performance and/or quality of service that it receives from the system. These constraints result in a basic trade-off between the total energy cost and client satisfaction in the system. In this paper, a resource allocation problem is considered that aims to minimize the total energy cost of cloud computing system while meeting the specified client-level SLAs in a probabilistic sense. The cloud computing system pays penalty for the percentage of a client's requests that do not meet a specified upper bound on their service time.

Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the distributed systems especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. In this paper, an SLA-based resource allocation problem in a server cluster is considered. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is the total price gained from serving the clients subtracted by the operation cost of the server cluster. The total price depends on the average request response time for each client as defined in their utility functions, while the operating cost is related to the total energy consumption. A joint optimization framework is proposed, comprised of request dispatching, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for individual cores, as well as server-level and core-level consolidations. Each core in the cluster is modeled using a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP). A near-optimal hierarchical solution is proposed, consisting of a central manager and distributed local agents. Each local agent employs linear programming-based CTMDP solving method to solve the DVFS problem for the corresponding core. The central manager solves the request dispatching problem and finds the optimal number of turned on cores and servers for request processing, thereby achieving a desirable tradeoff between service request response time and power consumption.

The delivery of such QoS-assured services requires the negotiation of end-to-end QoS contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) among NSPs and the configuration of their networks accordingly. The management of inter-NSP SLA negotiation is usually treated as an optimization problem, assuming that NSPs cooperate and agree on a common system, providing a solution for each demand. This assumption is quite strong in a highly competitive context where NSPs are cautious about sensitive data disclosure like topology or resource usage information or even SLA descriptions and prices. Hence, to meet NSPs' requirements on confidentiality, we opt for a distributed framework. In order to not over-provision demands, we consider the problem in a wider range: not only on the basis of instantaneous requests but also anticipating future ones. To enhance the chance of an NSP to be selected for an end-to-end service, we aim to take into account the demander likeliness of acceptance (aka. customer utility).

Precise definitions and metrics have to be explained. This article proposes an overview of Cloud QoS parameters as well as their classification, but also it defines usable metrics to evaluate QoS parameters. Moreover, the defined QoS metrics are measurable and reusable in any scheduling approach for Clouds. The use of these QoS models is done through the performance analysis of three scheduling approaches considering four QoS parameters. In addition to the energy consumption and the Response Time, two other QoS parameters are taken into account in different virtual machines scheduling approaches. These parameters are dynamism and robustness, which are usually not easily measurable. The evaluation is done through simulations, using two common scheduling algorithms and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for virtual machines (VMs) reallocation, allowing us to analyze the QoS parameters evolution in time. Simulation results have shown that including various and antagonist QoS parameters allows a deeper analysis of the intrinsic behavior and insight of these three algorithms.

Recently, various approaches have been developed to effectively reduce GPU power consumption by making GPU run at low frequencies. However, Virtual Machines (VMs) running on the same physical GPU with virtualization technology are correlated, because the change of GPU frequencies will affect the SLA performance of all the VMs. In fact, both reducing power consumption and guaranteeing SLA should work together under the considerations of their correlations. This paper proposes a novel two-layer control architecture called EvGPU (Energy-efficient SLA guarantees for virtualized GPU) based on well-established feedback control techniques.

The secondary power control loop then adjusts GPU frequency through Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to reduce power consumption based on the current FPS achieved by the first loop.

In general they have little chances to alter the standard contract the big providers are offering. Smaller providers might offer the possibility to include energy efficiency as a clause in their paper framework contract. However, so far there is no way to dynamically create a Service Level Agreement with a provider that includes a certain level of energy efficiency the provider guarantees. The European project OPTIMIS is focussing on optimisation of cloud infrastructure services meeting demands from service providers. Besides a number of other parameters like trust, risk, cost, data protection this also includes aspects of energy efficiency. We describe the standards-based approach of OPTIMIS for negotiating and creating Service Level Agreements between service providers and infrastructure providers regarding energy efficiency of a data centre.;;2012;Wolfgang Ziegler;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2414376.2414381;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;375;GreenSLAs: supporting energy-efficiency through contracts;"Outsourcing services from local or personal devices to data centers or the cloud is an ongoing trend in information technology. This trend has led to the expansion of the IT service business and, to a dramatic increase of energy consumption in data centers. One of the objectives of GreenIT is to stop or even reverse this development. Many technical approaches to save energy during the operational phase of a data center are currently being proposed. Unfortunately, a reduction of energy consumption may have a negative impact onto a customer's perceived quality-of-service as denoted in service level agreements (SLAs). Energy aware ""GreenSLAs"" can help counteracting this dilemma by extending a data center's scope to pursue energy saving measures at runtime.

Usually, cloud providers provide assurances by specifying technical and functional descriptions in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the services they offer. The descriptions in SLAs are not consistent among the cloud providers even though they offer services with similar functionality. Therefore, customers are not sure whether they can identify a trustworthy cloud provider only based on its SLA. To support the customers in reliably identifying trustworthy cloud providers, we propose a multi-faceted Trust Management (TM) system architecture for a cloud computing marketplace. This system provides means to identify the trustworthy cloud providers in terms of different attributes (e.g., security, performance, compliance) assessed by multiple sources and roots of trust information.;;2011;"Habib, Sheikh Mahbub; Ries, Sebastian; Muhlhauser, Max & Darmstadt, Technische Universit\""{a}t";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.392.6463 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2117692.2119048 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6120922;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;379;A virtual machine repacking in clouds: faster live migration algorithms;;excluded;2014;Hadji, Makhlouf & Laborg\`{e}re, Paul;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2627566.2627580;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;380;Dealer: application-aware request splitting for interactive cloud applications;Deploying interactive applications in the cloud is a challenge due to the high variability in performance of cloud services. In this paper, we present Dealer-- a system that helps geo-distributed, interactive and multi-tier applications meet their stringent requirements on response time despite such variability. Our approach is motivated by the fact that, at any time, only a small number of application components of large multi-tier applications experience poor performance. Dealer abstracts application structure as a component graph, with nodes being application components and edges capturing inter-component communication patterns. Dealer continually monitors the performance of individual component replicas and communication latencies between replica pairs. In serving any given user request, Dealer seeks to minimize user response times by picking the best combination of replicas (potentially located across different data-centers). While Dealer does require modifications to application code, we show through integration with two multi-tier applications that the changes required are modest. Our evaluations on two multi-tier applications using real cloud deployments indicate the 90%ile of application response times could be reduced by a factor of 3 under natural cloud dynamics compared to conventional data-center redirection techniques which are agnostic of application structure.;;2012;"Hajjat, Mohammad; N, Shankaranarayanan P.; Maltz, David; Rao, Sanjay & Sripanidkulchai, Kunwadee";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2413176.2413195;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;381;Building a Compliance Vocabulary to Embed Security Controls in Cloud SLAs;Mission critical information systems must be certified against a set of security controls to mitigate potential security incidents. Cloud service providers must in turn employ adequate security measures that conform to security controls expected by the organizational information systems they host. Since service implementation details are abstracted away by the cloud, organizations can only rely on service level agreements (SLAs) to assess the compliance of cloud security properties and processes. Various representation schema allow SLAs to embed service security terms, but are disconnected from documents regulating security controls. This paper demonstrates an extensible solution for building a compliance vocabulary that associates SLA terms with security controls. The terms allow services to express which security controls they comply with and enable at-a-glance comparison of security service offerings so organizations can distinguish among cloud service providers that best comply with security expectations. To exemplify the approach, we build a sample vocabulary of terms based on audit security controls from a standard set of governing documents and apply them to an SLA for an example cloud storage service.

When internal system details are abstracted away as part of the cloud architecture, the organization must rely on contractual obligations embedded in service level agreements (SLAs) to assess service offerings for security risk. Whenever an SLA is formed, the level of risk incurred is based on how well the offered service terms meet the organizational security demands. In the cloud, additional SLAs between third party cloud service providers are formed to federate cloud resources, effectively distributing organizational risk among the various providers involved in the negotiated federations or service compositions. At runtime, whenever a cloud or service violates its SLA with respect to security controls or cancels any security offerings, the risk of noncompliance with organizational security policies increases. This paper provides a process to adapt to the propagated changes of service provider security risks within a service composition or federation due to SLA violations. The process is based on a distributed risk-aware renegotiation algorithm that replaces services if they violate SLAs.;;2012;Hale, Matthew L. & Gamble, Rose;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.366.1913 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6477665;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;383;SecAgreement: Advancing Security Risk Calculations in Cloud Services;By choosing to use cloud services, organizations seek to reduce costs and maximize efficiency.

As internal system details are abstracted away as part of the cloud architecture, the organization must rely on contractual obligations embedded in service level agreements (SLAs) to assess service offerings. Current SLAs focus on quality of service metrics and lack the semantics needed to express security constraints that could be used to measure risk. We create a framework, called SecAgreement (SecAg), that extends the current SLA negotiation standard, WS-Agreement, to allow security metrics to be expressed on service description terms and service level objectives. The framework enables cloud service providers to include security in their SLA offerings, increasing the likelihood that their services will be used.

In this paper, we present an SLA ontology, encompassing the whole service lifecycle, in order to drive and improve the evaluation of services. We propose a common QoS ontology to express specifications, requirements and feedback. Based on this, we introduce a symmetric representation of service monitoring information and human feedback, allowing a unified management of the service evaluation.

Applications that involve heavy I/O activities, which are common in the cloud, probably benefit the most from caching. The use of local volatile memory as cache might be a natural alternative, but many well-known restrictions, such as capacity and the utilization of host machines, hinder its effective use. In addition to technical challenges, providing cache services in clouds encounters a major practical issue (quality of service or service level agreement issue) of pricing. Currently, (public) cloud users are limited to a small set of uniform and coarse-grained service offerings, such as High-Memory and High-CPU in Amazon EC2. In this paper, we present the cache as a service (CaaS) model as an optional service to typical infrastructure service offerings. Specifically, the cloud provider sets aside a large pool of memory that can be dynamically partitioned and allocated to standard infrastructure services as disk cache. We first investigate the feasibility of providing CaaS with the proof-of-concept elastic cache system (using dedicated remote memory servers) built and validated on the actual system, and practical benefits of CaaS for both users and providers (i.e., performance and profit, respectively) are thoroughly studied with a novel pricing scheme. Our CaaS model helps to leverage the cloud economy greatly in that 1) the extra user cost for I/O performance gain is minimal if ever exists, and 2) the provider's profit increases due to improvements in server consolidation resulting from that performance gain. Through extensive experiments with eight resource allocation strategies, we demonstrate that our CaaS model can be a promising cost-efficient solution for both users and providers.";;2012;"Han, Hyuck; Lee, Young Choon; Shin, Woong; Jung, Hyungsoo; Yeom, Heon Y. & Zomaya, Albert Y.";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2360765.2361187 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6095538;IEEE Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;393;Support Vector regression for Service Level Agreement violation prediction;"SLA is a contract between service providers and consumers, mandating specific numerical target values which the service needs to achieve.

Service Level Agreements(SLA) ensure the necessary guarantees to the highly dependent service consumers. There may be several rounds of negotiation before a formal SLA is established. During automated negotiation sessions, the service provider needs to understand consumer requests and is required to offer the closest possible service configuration fulfilling these requirements, keeping in view the preferences of the consumer on one hand and the business rules and configuration constraints of the service provider on the other. Service providers need to be prepared to expect demands for all possible permutation of service attributes. This requires a mechanism to map given expected values onto a discrete or continuous set of possibilities and then their refinement through multiple negotiation rounds.

In response, many enterprises are setting explicit sustainability goals and implementing initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. Quantification and disclosure of such goals and initiatives have become important marketing tools. As enterprises and individuals shift their workloads to the cloud, this drive toward quantification and disclosure will lead to demand for quantifiable green cloud services. Thus, we argue that cloud providers should offer a new class of green services, in addition to existing (energy-source-oblivious) services. This new class would provide clients with explicit service-level agreements (which we call Green SLAs) for the percentage of renewable energy used to run their workloads. In this paper, we first propose an approach for High Performance Computing cloud providers to offer such a Green SLA service. Specifically, each client job specifies a Green SLA, which is the minimum percentage of green energy that must be used to run the job. The provider earns a premium for meeting the Green SLA, but is penalized if it accepts the job but violates the Green SLA. We then propose (1) a power distribution and control infrastructure that uses a small amount of hardware to support Green SLAs, (2) an optimization-based framework for scheduling jobs and power sources that maximizes provider profits while respecting Green SLAs, and (3) two scheduling policies based on the framework. We evaluate our framework and policies extensively through simulations. Our main results show the tradeoffs between our policies, and their advantages over simpler greedy heuristics.

Contrail project will address the major concerns behind this reluctance namely mistrust in cloud platforms, lack of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Quality of Protection (QoP) of data. Contrail will provide a federation layer support for bringing a multitude of cloud providers, both private and public, together.

The use of standard protocols for publishing, discovery, invocation, process definition and SLA definition etc. (e.g. UDDI, WSDL, SOAP, BPEL, WS-Agreement, WS-Policy) has made it possible to compose highly usable composite systems with minimal efforts. On the other hand the existence of a number of functionally equivalent service provide the system designers with the flexibility of choosing the most appropriate services for the system. Hence, automated negotiation among Web services provides an effective way for the services to bargain for their optimal customizations and allow the discovery of overlooked potential solutions. In this paper, we present a Web service negotiation framework that would be used by both the customer and providers of Web services for conducting automated negotiations for quality of service properties of Web services. Our proposed framework is highly flexible, protocol independent and supports participant polices for communication, negotiation and service level agreement creation. We further extend our approach by extending WS-Negotiation and WS-Renegotiation to model multi-round negotiation for multiple attributes of negotiated services in a multi-service and multi-party negotiation scenarios. We also describe a semantic web rules based approach for converting compatible participant policies for mutual comprehension of Web service. We describe in detail the process of negotiating service level agreements using the semantic web rules based approach.;;2014;"Hashmi, Khayyam; Najmi, Erfan; Malik, Zaki; Medjahed, Brahim; Alhosban, Amal & Rezgui, Abdelmounaam";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2680847.2681463 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6930577;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;403;A framework of sensor-cloud integration opportunities and challenges;"In the past few years, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been gaining increasing attention because of their potential of enabling of novel and attractive solutions in areas such as industrial automation, environmental monitoring, transportation business, health-care etc. If we add this collection of sensor derived data to various Web-based social networks or virtual communities, blogs etc., we can have a remarkable transformation in our ability to ""see"" ourselves and our planet.

This can make losses incurred over a one or two hop path acceptable. However, as the number of hops in the path increases to three, four, and beyond packet losses inexorably add up and exceed the limits of these techniques. This can cause unacceptable interruptions in content delivery and make it impossible to meet service level agreements. In a wireless cloud with multiple entry points an incorrect entry point selection can result in unnecessary additional hops causing unacceptable interruption of service.

However, so far these applications provide limited multi-tenant monitoring supports, which prevents the applications from guaranteeing tenants' interests efficiently. In this paper, we propose an aspect-oriented approach to monitor multi-tenant applications based on tenant SLAs. Our approach includes monitoring code generation and runtime management. During code generation, the approach proposes an SLA feature model for tenants to specify variable requirements. Based on the requirements the approach selects code snippets, which are implemented as templates in advance, and splices them into an monitoring aspect. During runtime, the approach prioritizes aspects to determine execution order and updates monitoring status in term of tenant.

In this context, we provide a new perspective on the management of enterprise information systems and introduce a novel framework that harmonizes economic and operational goals. Concretely, we target elastic n-tier applications with dynamic on-demand cloud resource provisioning. We design and implement a novel integrated management model for information systems that induces economic influence factors into the operation strategy to adapt the performance goals of an enterprise information system dynamically (i.e., online at runtime). Our framework forecasts future user behavior based on historic data, analyzes the impact of workload on system performance based on a non-linear performance model, analyzes the economic impact of different provisioning strategies, and derives an optimal operation strategy. The evaluation of our prototype, based on a real production system workload trace, is carried out in a custom test infrastructure (i.e., cloud testbed, n-tier benchmark application, distributed monitors, and control framework), which allows us to evaluate our approach in depth, in terms of efficiency along the entire SLA lifetime.

However rising costs of operation and a growing system complexity are driving the search for a more efficient delivery of corporate computing. New technologies in the emerging service world such as cloud computing provide powerful alternatives to traditional IT operation concepts. Nonetheless, executive decision makers still have reservations about migrating to this new technology. In addition to security concerns, a key issue is the still prevailing lack of strict SLAs in these service offerings. In fact, service providers hesitate to offer strictly binding SLAs because assessing economic risk exposure is a major challenge. In this paper, we present a novel model for sustainable SLA design for enterprise information systems. Our model combines various state-of-the-art concepts from the field of system management and balances the failure risk with the cost of operation. More concretely, our model helps IT decision makers to understand the relationship between the operation cost and the service quality.

Estimates of request runtimes provided by users are often error prone. Both overestimation and underestimation of request runtimes are detrimental for system performance. Satisfying SLAS often require Advance Reservation (AR) of resources. This research presents a Soft Advance Reservation (SAR) approach for handling errors associated with estimates of request runtime provided by users. This approach relaxes the strict requirement that all Advance Reservation (AR) requests associated with their respective SLAs must meet their deadlines.

We propose a rigorous and unambiguous definition of availability in cloud services. In the light of this, we show that what appear to be apples-for-apples comparisons between real-world SLAs are often based on ambiguous definitions, and even where SLAs are well defined, they differ significantly in their interpretation of availability. We show how two example real-world SLAs, would lead one service provider to report 0\% availability while another would report 100\% for the same system state history. On the basis of this, the paper concludes by arguing for the importance of standardising availability definitions and examines which elements need to be standardised and, just as importantly, which do not. Many of the results of this paper can be generalised to service level attributes other than availability: in general, such standard service definitions are a key element of a true commodity market in cloud resources, allowing service comparability before purchase, redress in the case of failure to deliver expected value and enhancing accountability in the supply chain.;;2013;Hogben, Giles & Pannetrat, Alain;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6753821 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568486.2568551;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;415;Application-Aware Resource Allocation for SDN-based Cloud Datacenters;In cloud datacenters, since resource requirements change frequently, how to assign and manage resources efficiently while meeting service level agreements (SLAs) of different types of applications is an important research issue. In this paper, we propose an Application-aware Resource Allocation (App-RA) scheme to predict resource requirements and allocate an appropriate number of virtual machines (VMs) for each application in SDN-based cloud datacenters. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed App-RA is the first application-aware resource allocation scheme that adapts to all types of applications. The App-RA can meet SLAs, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce power consumption for each application in cloud datacenters. The proposed App-RA adopts the neural network based predictor to forecast the requirements of resources (CPU, Memory, GPU, Disk I/O and bandwidth) for an application. In the proposed App-RA, we have designed two algorithms which allocate appropriate numbers of virtual machines and use the VM allocation threshold to avoid SLA violations for five different types of applications. In addition, we adopt an SDN-based OpenFlow network with CICQ switches to appropriately schedule packets for different types of application in the network layer. Finally, simulation results show that the power consumption of the proposed App-RA is only 9.21\% higher than that of the best case (oracle) and the power consumption of EAACVA, which is a representative resource allocation method for non-graphic applications, is 104.58\% worse than that of App-RA.

They look for methods to maximize their profit margins by executing higher number of jobs while minimizing the operational costs and environmental footprints. Energy consumption of servers plays a crucial role in operational costs. There have been different methods to deal with energy consumption from hardware level to higher layers of abstractions such as compilers and operating systems. For example, several resource-scheduling policies have been proposed to not only regulate energy consumption but also guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA). One of the prevalent techniques in reducing the total energy consumption in data-centers is through consolidation of virtual machines (VMs). In this technique, one or several VMs migrate from a physical node to other nodes, which in turn incurs a significant overhead not only on a server but also on the network infrastructure of a cloud. To address this problem, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the unsurpassed utilization level to come up with optimal energy consumption while meeting a given QoS. In other words, our proposed algorithm aims to regulate execution speeds of VMs on a host with a result that the host works at its optimal energy level. In fact, a host is scheduled to run its allocated tasks faster to reach the optimum level of utilization instead of migrating its tasks to other hosts. We also propose several task scheduling policies to adjust execution speeds for real-time tasks in each VM.

One of the prevalent techniques in mitigating the total energy consumptions of data-centers is through using consolidation of virtual machines (VMs). However, it incurs significant overheads on both computing resources and network infrastructure of a cloud.

A SLA is a contract formed between a cloud service provider (CSP)and a user which specifies, in measurable terms, what resources a the CSP will provide the user. CSP's being profit based companies have incentive to cheat on the SLA. By providing a user with less resources than specified in the SLA the CSP can support more users on the same hardware and increase their profits. As the monitoring and verification of the SLA is typically performed on the cloud system itself it is straightforward for the CSP to lie on reports and hide their intentional breach of the SLA. To prevent such cheating we introduce a framework which makes use of a third party auditor (TPA). In this paper we are interested in CPU cheating only. To detect CPU cheating, we develop an algorithm which makes use of a commonly used CPU intensive calculation, transpose matrix multiplication, to randomly detect cheating by a CSP.

For each class, the SLA is specified by the relationship: Prob [response time ≤ x] ≥ y. Two server allocation strategies are considered: shared allocation (SA) and dedicated allocation (DA). For the case of FCFS scheduling, analytic results for response time distribution are used to develop a heuristic algorithm that determines an allocation strategy (SA or DA) that requires the smallest number of servers. The effectiveness of this algorithm is evaluated over a range of operating conditions. The performance of SA with non-FCFS scheduling is also investigated.

Here the focus is, however, on motion rather than computation. In the service-level agreement, a virtual vehicle is a virtual machine plus a virtual speed. We define virtual deadline for each task based on virtual speed, and make the spatial cloud a soft real-time system [7], [1]. The performance isolation is measured by the average of tardiness and delivery probability. We use Voronoi tessellation to allocate the tasks to the real vehicles, and design scheduling policies such as Earliest Virtual Deadline First (EVDF), Earliest Dynamic Virtual Deadline First (EDVDF) and credit scheduling policy for the real vehicles. EVDF is shown to minimize the tardiness. Under EVDF, we identify a worst case arrival process maximizing tardiness.

The time complexity of these algorithms is analyzed, which indicates that they are highly scalable. Performance is evaluated and compared with existing algorithms.

Since slacking non-critical jobs can achieve significant power saving, we exploit the slack room and allocate them in a global manner in our schedule. Using random generated and real-life application workflows, our results demonstrate that EES is able to reduce considerable energy consumption while still meeting SLA.;;2012;"Huang, Qingjia; Su, Sen; Li, Jian; Xu, Peng; Shuang, Kai & Huang, Xiao";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310173 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217511;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;428;Migration-Based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling in Cloud Data Center;Virtualization and cloud computing technologies now make it possible to consolidate multiple online services, which are packed in Virtual Machines (VMs), into a smaller number of physical servers. However, it is still a challenging scheduling problem for cloud provider to dynamically manage the VM allocation for handling variable workloads without Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. In this paper, we propose a Migration-based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling (MECS) mechanism to automate elastic resource scaling for cloud systems. Different from the previous researches, we take both the dynamic workload fluctuation and the VM migration overhead into account. We first develop an online resource demand predictor, which is an ARIMA-based VM resource demand state predictor, to achieve adaptive resource allocation for cloud applications. We then propose a migration-based elastic consolidation scheduling heuristic to dynamically consolidate the VMs with adaptive resource allocation for reducing the number of physical machines.

Many businesses have started using cloud computing. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a cloud service provider (CSP) and a user is a contract that specifies the resources and performances that the cloud should provide. However, a CSP has the incentive to cheat on SLA, e.g., providing users with less CPU and memory resources than that specified in the SLA, which allows the CSP to support more users and make more profits. Unfortunately, there are no tools to allow users to verify the SLA. We study the important issue of verifying SLA in a semi-trusted (or untrusted) cloud. In this paper, we focus on the verification of CPU speed, which is an important metric in cloud SLA. We propose a lightweight stealthy test algorithm that can check if a CSP provides the CPU speed as specified in the SLA. Using real experiments, we show that the algorithm can detect cloud cheating on CPU speed (i.e., SLA violations) in a stealthy way.;;2013;"Huang, Qiang; Ye, Lin; Liu, Xinran & Du, Xiaojiang";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2552868.2552909 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6655711;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;430;M-convex VM Consolidation: Towards a Better VM Workload Consolidation;Consolidating virtual machine workload is a unique feature of cloud computing platforms that greatly reduces the operating cost of the cloud data center. Correctly consolidating VMs’ workloads for a large scale cloud computing platform is nontrivial because a shortsighted scheme may save some cost in one aspect but becomes expensive in other aspects being neglected. In this paper, we present a framework that automates the VM consolidation process to improve the VMs and servers assignment whenever such improvement is possible. The proposed VM consolidation framework can achieve a balance among multiple administrative objectives (e.g., power cost, network cost) during the VM consolidation process. The solution method of solving the VM consolidation problem is designed based on the powerful and efficient semi quasi Mconvex optimization framework. The proposed algorithm can also produce VM consolidation solutions that require minimal system reconfigurations (e.g., VM migrations, turning on/off servers). More importantly, the proposed algorithm can be implemented distributedly so that the scalability of the proposed framework is greatly improved. As a result, the proposed framework is efficient, scalable and highly practical.;;2014;Huang, Zhe & Tsang, Danny;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6953123;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;431;A virtual machine consolidation framework for MapReduce enabled computing clouds;In nowadays computing clouds, it is of the cloud providers' economic interests to correctly consolidate the workload of the virtual machines (VMs) into the suitable physical servers in the cloud data center in order to minimize the total maintenance cost. However, during the consolidation process, sufficient protection should be provided to the service level agreement (SLA) of the VMs. In this paper, the VM consolidation problem for MapReduce enabled computing clouds has been investigated. In the MapReduce enabled computing clouds, MapReduce jobs are carried out by homogeneous MapReduce VM instances that have identical hardware resource. Two resource allocation schemes with corresponding SLA constraints for the MapReduce VMs and the non-MapReduce VMs are proposed. Based on these schemes, the VM consolidation problem is modeled as an integer nonlinear optimization problem and an efficient algorithm has been proposed to locate its solutions. The results show that better VM consolidation performance can be achieved by colocating MapReduce instances together with non-MapReduce instances in the same set of physical servers.;;2012;"Huang, Zhe; Tsang, Danny H.

Service Level Agreements (SLA) are formed between the user and provider to ensure that the required services and applications are delivered as expected. With the increase of public cloud providers, challenges such as availability, reliability, security, privacy and transactional risk demand detailed assessment during the formation of SLAs. This paper focuses on one subcategory of transactional risk while forming SLAs: namely, performance risk. We argue that performance risk assessment should be done by the user before entering into an SLA with a service provider. We propose to measure performance risk according to the specific context and assessment criteria with the aid of a semantic similarity model for the SLA requirement being negotiated in a cloud computing environment. We show through simulations that the performance risk analysis is more accurate using semantic similarity matching compared with analysis without semantic similarity matching.;;2010;"Hussain, Omar; Dong, Hai & Singh, Jaipal";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1926129.1926146;Springer-Verlag;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;436;Bandwidth-aware virtual machines allocation for high performance communication-intensive applications;Cloud computing has become a step up in computing whereby shared computation resources are provided on demand. As Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers provide more and more services to users, they also have to balance between the user's Service Level Agreement (SLAs) and the cost of resource usage. To optimize resource usage as low as possible while keeping user's SLA guaranteed is one of the most significant tasks. For those who use IaaS system to run their high performance applications such as communication-intensive applications, congestion of network becomes a critical problem. Sending a numerous requests to network-unaware scheduler maybe not processed due to network bottleneck while resource usage is very low. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a scheme of minimizing the required bandwidth consumption between every pair of virtual machines while keeping an introduced SLA to users.

One of the solutions for mutual nonrepudiation is based on logging attestations, which are signed messages. For every request, clients and service provider exchange attestations. These attestations will be used in an auditing protocol to verify their behavior. The chain-hashing scheme chains attestations and stores them in service provider for supporting write serializability and read freshness of files. However, the chain-hashing scheme is inefficient when files in an account can be accessed by multiple client devices interchangeably. In this paper we first show that the chain-hashing scheme cannot resist roll-back attack from service provider unless client devices keep all the attestations or there exists a way to broadcast the last attestation to all the client devices. We propose a scheme that can guarantee mutual nonrepudiation between the user and service provider without requiring the client devices to exchange any messages, and each client device only has to store the last attestation it received. We also propose how to apply the hash tree to remove accumulated attestations. The results from related experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

Cloud computing service elicits efficiency on on-demand resource usage and timely execution at any given time depending on experimental requirements. Hybrid clouds, composing of private and public clouds, even extend research opportunities on resource selection for further complicated experiments but increase the needs of dynamic resource management to maximize its utilization. At existing public cloud providers for commercial use, rule-based and schedule-based mechanisms have been tried for automatic resource allocation to provide resources for processing dynamic workload of modern applications. However, most of the auto-scaling methods just simply support performance metric such as CPU utilization but rarely are aware of Service Level Agreements (SLA) including execution deadline or cost.

In such environments, when applying ICMP connectivity checks and conventional fault detection methods such as IP-SLA, it takes time to recover from faults to allow for coordination between the core network and the user logical networks in the cloud.

Most IaaS offerings are presented to customers as fixed-size and fixed-price SLAs, that do not match well the needs of specific applications. Furthermore, arbitrary colocation of applications with different SLAs may result in inefficient utilization of hosts' resources, resulting in economically undesirable customer behavior.In this thesis, we propose the design and architecture of a Colocation as a Service (CaaS) framework: a set of strategic and operational services that allow the efficient colocation of customer workloads. CaaS strategic services provide customers the means to specify their application workload using an SLA language that provides them the opportunity and incentive to take advantage of any tolerances they may have regarding the scheduling of their workloads. CaaS operational services provide the information necessary for, and carry out the reconfigurations mandated by strategic services. We recognize that it could be the case that there are multiple, yet functionally equivalent ways to express an SLA. Thus, towards that end, we present a service that allows the provably-safe transformation of SLAs from one form to another for the purpose of achieving more efficient colocation.

The resources are dynamically chosen to satisfy a user Service Level Agreement and a required level of performance. A Cloud is seen as a computing platform for heavy load applications. Conjugate Gradient (CG) method is an iterative linear solver which is used by many scientific and engineering applications to solve a linear system of algebraic equations. CG generates a heavy load of computation and therefore it slows the performance of the applications using it. Distributing CG is considered as a way to increase its performance. However, running a distributed CG, based on a standard API, such as MPI, in a Cloud face many challenges, such as the Cloud processing and networking capabilities. In this work, we present an in-depth analysis of the CG algorithm and its complexity in order to develop adequate distributed algorithms. The implementation of these algorithms and their evaluation in our Cloud environment reveals the gains and losses achieved by distributing the CG. The performance results show that despite the complexity of the CG processing and communication, a speedup gain of at least 1,157.7 is obtained using 128 cores compared to NAS sequential execution.

In large data-centers faults are prone to happen and thus the only reasonable cost-effective method of providing high availability of services is an SLA aware recovery plan; that is, a mapping of the service VMs onto backup machines where they can be executed in case of a failure. The recovery process may benefit from powering on some of these machines in advance, since redeployment on powered machines is much faster. However, this comes with an additional maintenance cost, so the real problem is how to balance between the expected recovery time improvement and the cost of machines activation. We model this problem as an offline optimization problem and present a bicriteria approximation algorithm for it. While this is the first performance guaranteed algorithm for this problem, it is somewhat complex to implement in practice. Thus, we further present a much simpler and practical heuristic based on a greedy approach. We evaluate the performance of this heuristic over real data-center data, and show that it performs well in terms of scale, hierarchical faults and variant costs.

Consequently, many researchers are actively involved in cloud computing research projects. One major challenge facing cloud computing researchers is the lack of a comprehensive cloud computing experimental tool to use in their studies. This paper introduces CloudExp, a modeling and simulation environment for cloud computing. CloudExp can be used to evaluate a wide spectrum of cloud components such as processing elements, data centers, storage, networking, Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints, web-based applications, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), virtualization, management and automation, and Business Process Management (BPM). Moreover, CloudExp introduces the Rain workload generator which emulates real workloads in cloud environments. Also, MapReduce processing model is integrated in CloudExp in order to handle the processing of big data problems.;;2014;"Jararweh, Yaser; Jarrah, Moath; Kharbutli, Mazen; Alshara, Zakarea; Alsaleh, Mohammed Noraden & Al-Ayyoub, Mahmoud";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569190X14001464;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;456;Managing OVF applications under SLA constraints on contrail virtual execution platform;The move of users and organizations to Cloud computing will become possible when they will be able to exploit their own applications, applications and services provided by cloud providers as well as applications from third party providers in a trustful way on different cloud infrastructures. To reach this goal, standard application formats must be enabled on the cloud to avoid vendor lock-in, and guarantees concerning protection, performance and security must be supported.

In the proposed algorithm user behavior and workloads are characterized through the historical and real time performance profiling and estimation from hosted agents within individual VMs. The resources are allocated according to the demand as well as the performance of the targeted VMs based on the Suffer age aggregation and performance feedback. Experiments on a real Xen based virtualization environment with 3 VMs are conducted and evaluated for accuracy, efficiency, sensitivity, and overhead. The results show that the performance feedback based allocation can achieve a higher SLA satisfaction rate as 97.5\%, a lower load imbalance index as 17.6\%. The results also show that this algorithm is valid, effective and scalable for implementation in real virtualized environments.;;2011;"Jiang, Congfeng; Xu, Xianghua; Zhang, Jilin; Li, Yunfa & Wan, Jian";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6051777 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2065356.2065606;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;458;Guide-copy: Fast and silent migration of virtual machine for datacenters;Cloud infrastructure providers deploy Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) to minimize the cost of datacenter operation, while maintaining the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such DRM schemes depend on the capability to migrate virtual machine (VM) images. However, existing migration techniques are not suitable for highly utilized clouds due to their latency and bandwidth critical memory transfer mechanisms. In this paper, we propose guide-copy migration, a novel VM migration scheme to provide a fast and silent migration, which works nicely under highly utilized clouds. The guide-copy migration transfers only the memory pages accessed at the destination node in the near future by running a guide version of the VM at the source node and a migrated VM at the destination node simultaneously during the migration. The guide-copy migration's highly accurate and low-bandwidth memory transfer mechanism enables a fast and silent VM migration to maintain the SLA of all VMs in the cloud.;;2013;"Jihun Kim; Dongju Chae; Jangwoo Kim & Jong Kim";;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;459;Towards Optimized Fine-Grained Pricing of IaaS Cloud Platform;"Although many pricing schemes in IaaS platform are already proposed with pay-as-you-go and subscription/spot market policy to guarantee service level agreement, it is still inevitable to suffer from wasteful payment because of coarsegrained pricing scheme. In this paper, we investigate an optimized fine-grained and fair pricing scheme. Two tough issues are addressed: (1) the profits of resource providers and customers often contradict mutually; (2) VM-maintenance overhead like startup cost is often too huge to be neglected. Not only can we derive an optimal price in the acceptable price range that satisfies both customers and providers simultaneously, but we also find a best-fit billing cycle to maximize social welfare (i.e., the sum of the cost reductions for all customers and the revenue gained by the provider). We carefully evaluate the proposed optimized fine-grained pricing scheme with two large-scale real-world production traces (one from Grid Workload Archive and the other from Google data center). We compare the new scheme to classic coarse-grained hourly pricing scheme in experiments and find that customers and providers can both benefit from our new approach. The maximum social welfare can be increased up to 72:98\% and 48:15\% with respect to DAS-2 trace and Google trace respectively.";;2014;"Jin, Hai; Wang, Xinhou; Wu, Song; Di, Sheng & Shi, Xuanhua";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6868291;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;460;Optimal Cloud Resource Auto-Scaling for Web Applications;In the on-demand cloud environment, web application providers have the potential to scale virtual resources up or down to achieve cost-effective outcomes. True elasticity and cost-effectiveness in the pay-per-use cloud business model, however, have not yet been achieved. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cloud resource auto-scaling scheme at the virtual machine (VM) level for web application providers. The scheme automatically predicts the number of web requests and discovers an optimal cloud resource demand with cost-latency trade-off. Based on this demand, the scheme makes a resource scaling decision that is up or down or NOP (no operation) in each time-unit re-allocation. We have implemented the scheme on the Amazon cloud platform and evaluated it using three real-world web log datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves resource auto-scaling with an optimal cost-latency trade-off, as well as low SLA violations.;;2013;"Jing Jiang; Jie Lu; Guangquan Zhang & Guodong Long";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546059;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;461;A Business Model for Cloud Computing Based on a Separate Encryption and Decryption Service;Enterprises usually store data in internal storage and install firewalls to protect against intruders to access the data. They also standardize data access procedures to prevent insiders to disclose the information without permission. In cloud computing, the data will be stored in storage provided by service providers. Service providers must have a viable way to protect their clients' data, especially to prevent the data from disclosure by unauthorized insiders. Storing the data in encrypted form is a common method of information privacy protection. If a cloud system is responsible for both tasks on storage and encryption/decryption of data, the system administrators may simultaneously obtain encrypted data and decryption keys. This allows them to access information without authorization and thus poses a risk to information privacy. This study proposes a business model for cloud computing based on the concept of separating the encryption and decryption service from the storage service. Furthermore, the party responsible for the data storage system must not store data in plaintext, and the party responsible for data encryption and decryption must delete all data upon the computation on encryption or decryption is complete. A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) service is described in this paper as an example to illustrate the proposed business model. The exemplary service utilizes three cloud systems, including an encryption and decryption system, a storage system, and a CRM application system. One service provider operates the encryption and decryption system while other providers operate the storage and application systems, according to the core concept of the proposed business model.

The huge resource pool on the Cloud forms an appropriate platform for running applications with both computing and data intensity, like the DNA sequencing workflows. This paper studies the topic of running scientific workflows on multiple Clouds, with the DNA sequencing workflow as a driven application. We focus on the problem of matching the workflow functional and non-functional Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements to the compute and storage services provisioned by underlying Clouds with different service price and quality. We designed an ontological model for a semantic description of the problem and developed a novel utility-based genetic matching algorithm for selecting the Cloud services with respect to the user requirements and the properties of the Clouds. We validated the approach by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with other matching algorithms in executing the DNA sequencing application on a realistic simulation platform.

Today, users are interested to execute their workflow applications in the Cloud to exploit the economic and technical benefits of this new emerging technology. The deployment and management of workflows over the current existing heterogeneous and not yet interoperable Cloud providers, however, is still a challenging task for the workflow developers. In this paper, we present a broker-based framework for running workflows in a multi-Cloud environment. The framework allows an automatic selection of the target Clouds, a uniform access to the Clouds, and workflow data management with respect to user Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements. Following a simulation approach, we evaluated the framework with a real scientific workflow application in different deployment scenarios.

Computing is no longer purchased as typical products but delivered as a service over the Internet from large data centres. However, despite the potential benefits associated with the migration of enterprise appli- cations from an in-house data centre into a Cloud infrastructure, there are still some issues that hinder the process. In this respect, a migrated application should satisfy spe- cific enterprise policies related to privacy and security, as well as provide an acceptable quality of service. Because of the complexity of enterprise applications today with respect to the large number of components deployed in multi-tier architectures, the complexity of the interactions between them and the components’ dependence on stored data, the mi- gration process has to be assisted. Therefore it is presented a framework able to auto- mate the decision-making process related to the migration of different components to a virtualized Cloud system based on a model which factors in benefits and disadvantages associated with the migration subject to the fulfilment of the SLA and the respect of policy constraints. The presented approach envisions an application hosted both partly on- premise and on the Cloud. Resulting migrated applications need to be compliant with enterprise and security policies’ constraints while minimizing costs and ensuring perfor- mance in terms of wide area network communications and response times. The frame- work relies on a model to efficiently decide on the component placement. A model which takes into account several factors such as enterprise policies, dynamic performance bot- tlenecks, data sensibility, performance, cost savings from migration, data flows between application components, and the spread and variability of users. On the one hand the migration could lower the SLA (Service Level-Agreement) while on the other hand the deployment on the Cloud would provide the ability to handle peaks in workload and a higher reliability due to the higher level of replication, the existence of multiple fault domains and the deployment of the application on multiple Clouds. With respect to the latter, it will be assessed the deployment on different Clouds depending on the constraints imposed by them. The presented framework relies on algorithms and a formal decision model in order to assist developers in migrating existing applications. With the aim of empirically evaluate the overall framework, a prototypical implementation of the frame- work will be used in order to support the migration to a Cloud-based environment of an existing product configurator. The empirical validation will be used to further improve the input model on which the decision-making process was founded.;;;Juan-verdejo, Adri\'{a}n & G, Cas Software A.;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.402.9491;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;465;Applying Scheduling Algorithms with QoS in the Cloud Computing;Cloud computing is the model to use existing computing resources that are delivered as a form of service over a network. These services can be divided into three parts with software, platform, and infrastructure. It is important to evaluate cloud computing environment to predict valid cost to manage the cloud computing system. SimJava and GridSim is well-known simulation tools but they do not support the virtualization of cloud computing. CloudSim is only tool which can evaluate the performance of this environment and it is based on SimJava and GridSim. It is suitable to simulate the situation with large amount of devices and data in cloud computing. Also, it can simulate the virtualization of computing nodes, network devices, and storage units. Service provider has to guarantee quality of service to provide stable related services. For this, we can use the scheduling algorithms. However, there is no consideration of data priority in CloudSim. It is important to support QoS to keep the service level agreement. Thus, it is needed to research a scheduling algorithm to support QoS. In this paper, we propose the way to support various scheduling algorithms in CloudSim.;;2013;"Jung, Sung-Min; Kim, Nam-Uk & Chung, Tai-Myoung";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6579336;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;466;Towards self-caring mapreduce: Proactively reducing fault-induced execution-time penalties;Self-Caring IT systems are those that can proactively avoid system failures rather than reactively handle failures after they have occurred. In this paper, we are interested in failures in which a MapReduce job is unable to execute within an SLA-based completion time. The existing fault tolerance capability provided by Map Reduce frameworks is simple and the penalty associated with handling failures could potentially lead to excessive job execution times. Our goal in this paper is to bring out the severity of this penalty for different job characteristics and configurable framework parameters. We first quantitatively evaluate the penalty in execution time associated with node failures in the open-source MapReduce framework, Hadoop using the MRPerf simulator. This increase in execution time is particularly expensive in pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructures where users are charged by resource usage duration. Our solution minimizes job-completion-time SLA violations by augmenting the existing fault-tolerance capability of the MapReduce framework using a dynamic resource scaling approach. This resource scaling approach leverages the elastic properties of a cloud, in order to mitigate execution time penalties and hence proactively avoids a potential job failure. Using our proposed approach for various job and framework parameters, we show that performance penalties can be decreased by up to 78\% in the case of singlenode failures and by up to 100\% in the case of 4-node failures at minimal additional cost.;;2011;Kadirvel, Selvi & Fortes, Jose A.

In order to provide high availability, enable Service Level Agreement (SLA) and respond effectively to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of computing resources, we proposed a well-designed monitoring system for CloudStack platform named SCM. The SCM monitoring system collects accurate metrics from both physical and virtual resources, including the main components of ACS (system virtual machines, Secondary Storage, Primary Storage and management servers), and makes these data easily accessible and human readable, which is quite friendly to the CloudStack users.

Computing requirements (all the way to High Performance Computing or HPC), criticality, communication intensity, memory requirements, and scale can vary widely. Virtual Machine (VM) placement and consolidation for effective utilization of a common pool of resources for efficient execution of such diverse class of applications in the cloud is challenging, resulting in higher cost and missed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). For HPC, current cloud providers either offer dedicated cloud with dedicated nodes, losing out on consolidation benefits of virtualization, or use HPC-agnostic cloud scheduling resulting in poor HPC performance. In this work, we address application-aware allocation of n VM instances (comprising a single job request) to physical hosts from a single pool. We design and implement an HPC-aware scheduler on top of OpenStack Compute (Nova) and also incorporate it in a simulator (CloudSim). Through various optimizations, specifically topology- and hardware-awareness, cross-VM interference accounting and application-aware consolidation, we demonstrate enhanced VM placements which achieve up to 45 % improvement in HPC performance and/or 32 % increase in job throughput while limiting the effect of jitter (or noise) to 8%.;;;"Kal\'{e}, Laxmikant V.; Milojicic, Dejan; Faraboschi, Paolo & Balle, Susanne M.";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.294.6355;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;470;An Approach for Dynamic Scaling of Resources in Enterprise Cloud;"Elasticity is one of the key governing properties of cloud computing that has major effects on cost and performance directly.

Location of data and processes makes the difference in the realm of computation. On one hand, an individual has full control on data and processes in his/her computer. On the other hand, we have the cloud computing wherein, the service and data maintenance is provided by some vendor which leaves the client/customer unaware of where the processes are running or where the data is stored. So, logically speaking, the client has no control over it. The cloud computing uses the internet as the communication media. When we look at the security of data in the cloud computing, the vendor has to provide some assurance in service level agreements (SLA) to convince the customer on security issues. Organizations use cloud computing as a service infrastructure, critically like to examine the security and confidentiality issues for their business critical insensitive applications. Yet, guaranteeing the security of corporate data in the ""cloud"" is difficult, if not impossible, as they provide different services like Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Each service has their own security issues. So the SLA has to describe different levels of security and their complexity based on the services to make the customer understand the security policies that are being implemented. There has to be a standardized way to prepare the SLA irrespective to the providers. This can help some of the enterprises to look forward in using the cloud services.

Many researches about cloud computing have been focused on VM management to satisfy both the cost minimization and acceptable QoS assurance. However, in previous studies, only VM allocation scheme that maps the single request to single instance has been considered, therefore the unnecessary extra capacity of resources has been dissipated. In this paper, we design an Adaptive Resource Cloud Framework(ARCF) with group VM allocating scheme called Multi Requests to Single VM(MRSV) to solve the problems of previous researches.

In general, the VM instance is allocated to cloud service users based on not actual job processing time but the fixed resource allocation time predetermined by cloud pricing policy in contrast to grid environment. In this case, the unnecessary cost dissipation is occurred by the wasted partial instance hours of allocated resource. To address this problem, we propose the heuristic based workflow scheduling scheme considering cloud-pricing model in this paper. Our scheme is composed of two phases: VM packing and MRSR (Multi Requests to Single Resource) phases. In VM-packing phase, preassigned multi tasks are aggregated into the common VM instance sequentially, and these tasks are merged in parallel by MRSR phase. By using our proposed schemes, we are able to reduce the number of required VM instances and achieve the significant cost saving while we guarantee the user's SLA (Service Level Agreement) in terms of workflow deadline. Our proposed schemes cannot only reduce the cost by 30% compared to traditional workflow scheduling schemes but also assure user's SLA.;;2014;"Kang, Dong-Ki; Kim, Seong-Hwan; Youn, Chan-Hyun & Chen, Min";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557977.2558079;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;474;DAPA: diagnosing application performance anomalies for virtualized infrastructures;As cloud service providers leverage server virtualization to host applications in virtual machines (VMs), they must ensure proper allocation of resource capacities in order to satisfy the contracted service level agreements (SLAs) with the application owners.

To avoid this scenario, I enable the application to scale it across multiple independent cloud datacenters by forming federated clouds. In such a case, from the customer's point of view it is always difficult to decide whose resources they should use. To handle this case a ranking mechanism is proposed which measures the quality and prioritize the cloud resources.

For effective network bandwidth utilization and reducing the total migration time, we introduce a learning phase to estimate the writable working set (WWS) prior to the migration, resulting in an almost single time transfer of the pages. Our approach decreases the total data transfer by 1.16 x - 12.21x and the total migration time by a factor of 1.42x - 9.84x against the existing approaches, thus providing a fast and an efficient, reliable VM migration of the VMs in the cloud.;;2014;"Kashyap, Sanidhya; Dhillon, Jaspal Singh & Purini, Suresh";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2679108.2679236;IEEE Computer Society;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;480;SCDA: SLA-Aware Cloud Datacenter Architecture for Efficient Content Storage and Retrieval;With the fast growth of (online) content and the need for high quality content services, cloud data centers are increasingly becoming the preferred places to store data and retrieve it from. With a highly variable network traffic and limited resources, efficient server selection and data transfer rate allocation mechanisms become necessary. However, current approaches rely on random server selection schemes and inefficient data transmission rate control mechanisms. In this paper we present SCDA, an efficient server selection, resource allocation and enforcement mechanism with many salient features. SCDA has prioritized rate allocation mechanism to satisfy different service level agreements (SLA)s on throughput and delays. The allocation scheme can achieve max/min fairness. SCDA has a mechanism to detect and hence mitigate SLA violation in realtime. We have implemented SCDA in the NS2 simulator. Extensive experimental results confirm some of the design goals of SCDA to obtain a lower content transfer time and a higher throughput.

Multi-tenancy service is one service concept of a SaaS. A tenant can customize personal requirements in a multi-tenancy service configuration by negotiating with the service provider. The configuration items are recorded in a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Due to the popularity of software services, there are various services for the tenant to choose from. How to select a reasonable service from various multi-tenancy services has become an important issue. Therefore, this research explores the utility function of the SLA and uses an approach for the optimal selection of a multi-tenancy service based on a SLA utility function. The approach formalizes the SLA and discusses a utility model for the SLA's configuration items. Then, the multi-criteria decision analysis method is used to discover the reasonable selection order of multi-tenancy services. The selection order helps a tenant acquire a reasonable multi-tenancy service which meets his personal requirements.;;2012;"Ke, Chih-Kun; Lin, Zheng-Hua; Wu, Mei-Yu & Chang, Shih-Fang";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310661.2311128 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6228333;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;482;Facilitating Self-Adaptable Inter-cloud Management;Cloud Computing infrastructures have been developed as individual islands, and mostly proprietary solutions so far. However, as more and more infrastructure providers apply the technology, users face the inevitable question of using multiple infrastructures in parallel. Federated cloud management systems offer a simplified use of these infrastructures by hiding their proprietary solutions. As the infrastructure becomes more complex underneath these systems, the situations (like system failures, handling of load peaks and slopes) that users cannot easily handle, occur more and more frequently. Therefore, federations need to manage these situations autonomously without user interactions. This paper introduces a methodology to autonomously operate cloud federations by controlling their behavior with the help of knowledge management systems. Such systems do not only suggest reactive actions to comply with established Service Level Agreements (SLA) between provider and consumer, but they also find a balance between the fulfillment of established SLAs and resource consumption.

Therefore, many researches are carried out to develop new methods in order to consume less energy.

Moreover, we propose a Pareto Multi-Objective version of the EMLS-ONC called EMLS-ONC-MO dealing with both the energy consumption and the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The objective is to find a Pareto tradeoff between reducing the energy consumption of the cloud while preserving the performance of Virtual Machines (VMs). The different schedulers have been experimented using different arrival scenarios of VMs and different hardware configurations (artificial and real). The results show that EMLS-ONC and EMLS-ONC-MO outperform the other energy- and performance-aware algorithms in addition to the one provided in OpenNebula by a significant margin on the considered criteria.

But, like most things in life, the benefits come with risks. It's just a matter of knowing if the benefits outweigh the risks and vice versa. Unfortunately, the cloud computing does not escape to this universal rule. Then, it is important to consider the security of the cloud. As a solution to protect the cloud from security issues [1, 2, 3, 4], we think that IDSs integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution. We will also present an architecture based IDS that respects multi-tenancy architecture. The objective behind integrating multi-tenancy aspect in our solution is to give tenants the ability to configure some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code. This means that although tenants an using the same building blocks in their configuration, the appearance or workflow of the application may be different for two tenants. Also, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of each tenant can differ. In fact, we contend that multi-tenancy is a requirement for any cloud architecture because of four key benefits. First, High security: there are 3 key components that define the degree of isolation between multiple tenants in a data center: access policies, application deployment and data access and protection. Second, Economy: software development and maintenance costs are shared between the tenants. Third, Service assurance and faster updates: with multi-tenancy, the provider has to make updates once. In contrast with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to application code. Fourth, Efficiency and flexibility: A SaaS provider can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multipl- customers.

This paper presents group-based memory oversubscription that confines both mechanism and policy of memory oversubscription into a group of virtual machines. A group is specified as one of service level agreements so that a cloud customer can control the memory management mechanism within its own isolated domain. We introduce group-based memory deduplication and reprovisioning with several policies based on per-group workload behaviors. The proposed scheme is implemented on the KVM-based prototype and evaluated with realistic cloud workloads such as MapReduce and MPI applications.

However, due to non-negligible resource initiation time, network fluctuations or unpredictable workload, it becomes hard to guarantee QoS levels and SLA violations may occur. This paper proposes a language support for Cloud elasticity management that relies on CSLA (Cloud Service Level Agreement). CSLA offers new features such as QoS/functionality degradation and an advanced penalty model that allow providers to finely express contracts so that services self-adaptation capabilities are improved and SLA violations minimized. The approach was evaluated with a real infrastructure and application test bed. Experimental results show that the use of CSLA makes Cloud services capable of absorbing more peaks and oscillations by trading-off the QoS levels and costs due to penalties.;;2014;"Kouki, Yousri; de Oliveira, Frederico Alvares; Dupont, Simon & Ledoux, Thomas";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846456;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;509;Translation of Application-level Terms to Resourcelevel attributes across the Cloud Stack Layers;The emergence of new environments such as Cloud computing highlighted new challenges in traditional fields like performance estimation. Most of the current cloud environments follow the Software, Platform, Infrastructure service model in order to map discrete roles / providers according to the offering in each “layer”. However, the limited amount of information passed from one layer to the other has raised the level of difficulty in translating user-understandable application terms from the Software layer to resource specific attributes, which can be used to manage resources in the Platform and Infrastructure layers. In this paper, a generic black box approach, based on Artificial Neural Networks is used in order to perform the aforementioned translation. The efficiency of the approach is presented and validated through different application scenarios (namely FFMPEG encoding and real-time interactive e-Learning) that highlight its applicability even in cases where accurate performance estimation is critical, as in cloud environments aiming to facilitate real-time and interactivity.;;2011;"Kousiouris, George; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis; Gogouvitis, Spyridon; Menychtas, Andreas; Konstanteli, Kleopatra & Varvarigou, Theodora";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.6886 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5984009;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;510;Dynamic, behavioral-based estimation of resource provisioning based on high-level application terms in Cloud platforms;Delivering Internet-scale services and IT-enabled capabilities as computing utilities has been made feasible through the emergence of Cloud environments. While current approaches address a number of challenges such as quality of service, live migration and fault tolerance, which is of increasing importance, refers to the embedding of users’ and applications’ behaviour in the management processes of Clouds. The latter will allow for accurate estimation of the resource provision (for certain levels of service quality) with respect to the anticipated users’ and applications’ requirements. In this paper we present a two-level generic black-box approach for behavioral-based management across the Cloud layers (i.e., Software, Platform, Infrastructure): it provides estimates for resource attributes at a low level by analyzing information at a high level related to application terms (Translation level) while it predicts the anticipated user behaviour (Behavioral level). Patterns in high-level information are identified through a time series analysis, and are afterwards translated to low-level resource attributes with the use of Artificial Neural Networks. We demonstrate the added value and effectiveness of the Translation level through different application scenarios: namely FFMPEG encoding, real-time interactive e-Learning and a Wikipedia-type server. For the latter, we also validate the combined level model through a trace-driven simulation for identifying the overall error of the two-level approach.;;2014;"Kousiouris, George; Menychtas, Andreas; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis; Gogouvitis, Spyridon & Varvarigou, Theodora";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2565361.2565420 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X12001057;Elsevier Science Publishers B.

This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage(e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today's platform environments.;;2014;"Krebs, Rouven; Spinner, Simon; Ahmed, Nadia & Kounev, Samuel";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846447;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;512;Trust management system for Opportunistic Cloud Services;We have over the past three years been working on the feasibility of Opportunistic Cloud Services (OCS) for enterprises.

While originating from the domain of telecommunications the SLA concept has gained particular attention for Grid computing environments. Significant focus has been given so far to automated negotiation and agreement (also considering legal constraints) of SLAs between parties. However, how a provider that has agreed to a certain SLA is able to map and implement this on its own physical resources or on the ones provided by collaboration partners is not well covered.

As cloud computing provides the facility to the cloud users to send multiple request simultaneously, there must be a self managing/provisioning scheme that all resources are made available to the requesting users in the efficient manner to satisfy their requirement and for improvement of resource utilization. In this paper we proposed an efficient framework named called EARA (Efficient Agent based Resource Allocation) for resource allocation based on agent computing on SaaS level in Cloud Computing.

In an attempt to achieve the seemingly irreconcilable goals of maximum usage and minimum turnaround time this research aims to adapt an open-framework benchmarking scheme to supply information to a mouldable job scheduler. In a green IT obsessed world, hardware efficiency and usage of computer systems becomes essential. With an average computer rack consuming between 7 and 25 kW it is essential that resources be utilized in the most optimum way possible. Currently the batch schedulers employed to manage these multi-user multi-application environments are nothing more than match making and service level agreement (SLA) enforcing tools. These management systems rely on user prescribed parameters that can lead to over or under booking of compute resources. System administrators strive to get maximum “usage efficiency” from the systems by manual fine-tuning and restricting queues. Existing mouldable scheduling strategies utilize scalability characteristics, which are inherently 2-dimensional and cannot provide predictable scheduling information. In this paper we have considered existing benchmarking schemes and tools, schedulers and scheduling strategies, and elastic computational environments. We are proposing a novel job management system that will extract performance characteristics of an application, with an associated dataset and workload, to devise optimal resource allocations and scheduling decisions.

Unfortunately, previous solutions considered the problem from one end only, lacking device-to-cloud virtual organizations (VOrgs), end-to-end VOrg isolation, and automated security supervision. This paper presents Orange MC2, a new security architecture and implementation overcoming such limitations. For homogeneous security SLA guarantees, execution environments in device and cloud domains are dynamically set up into VOrgs called MC2s, forming end-to-end security planes over the infrastructure. Strict plane separation is agnostic to underlying isolation mechanisms using a policy framework for security policy distribution and enforcement throughout an MC2. Security may be autonomically regulated at several levels of granularity in MC2s, both across domains and infrastructure layers. The paper also reports on a case study implementation.

Mobile networks are redesigned, placed upon and operated on cloud computing platforms. These then are available with the on-demand, elastic and pay-as-you-go characteristics derived from the cloud principles. In this platform, a variety of services including heterogeneous radio networking, federated computing resources, virtualized network functions, support services and high-level applications are automatically and seamlessly orchestrated in composite end-to-end services delivered to enterprise end-users. The management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for these cloud-based composite services requires a dedicated framework to combine and jointly manage the multiple SLAs associated to the different service components.

We then identify five basic Load Types that a dynamic SLA system must manage: Best Effort, Throttled, Load Migration, Preemption and Spare Capacity. The key to meeting application SLA requirements under changing surge conditions is to also manage the spare surge capacity. The use of this surge capacity could be managed by one of several identified load migration policies.

To provide Internet application service by using cloud resource, a service provider needs to consider the resource subscription cost and Service Level Agreement (SLA) of its users. Several kinds of pricing model of cloud resource subscription have been proposed. In such case, the Internet service provider plays the role of a cloud customer with a need of optimal cloud resource subscription policy to reduce its operation cost. Therefore, how to determine a suitable policy of cloud resource subscription has become a challenging issue. In this work, we proposed a two-phase approach to solve the cloud resource subscription problem. The first phase considered long-term resource reservation. In this phase, we proposed a mathematic model to compute an upper bound of the optimal amount of long-term reserved resource. The second phase was dynamic resource subscription phase. In order to overcome dynamic resource demand, in this phase, we used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict resource demand and allocate VM resource adaptively based on the prediction.

In both cases, our aim is to improve Critical Section execution rate and to reduce the number of SLA violations, which, for the first algorithm represents the number of priority inversions (i.e. a higher priority request is satisfied after a lower one) and for the second one, the number of requests whose deadline is not respected.

The ability to offload user software and data to cloud data centers has raised many security and privacy concerns over the cloud computing model. Significant research efforts have focused on hyper visor security and low-layer operating system implementations in cloud data centers. Unfortunately, the role of cloud carrier in the security and privacy of user software and data has not been well studied. Cloud carrier represents the wide area network that provides the connectivity and transport of cloud services between cloud consumers and cloud providers. In this paper, we present a risk assessment framework to study the security risk of the cloud carrier between cloud consumers and cloud providers. The risk assessment framework leverages the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to examine the security vulnerabilities of operating systems of routers within the cloud carrier. This framework provides quantifiable security metrics for cloud carrier, which enables cloud consumers to establish the quality of security services among cloud providers. Such security metric information is very useful in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation between a cloud consumer and a cloud provider. It can be also be used to build a tool to verify SLA compliance. Furthermore, we implement this framework for the cloud carriers of Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure Platform.

Interactive multimedia content-driven applications in the domains of healthcare, aged-care, and education have emerged as one of the new classes of big data applications. This new generation of applications need to support complex content operations including production, deployment, consumption, personalization, and distribution. However, to efficiently provision these applications on the Cloud data centres, there is a need to understand their runtime resource configurations. For example: (i) where to store and distribute the content to and from driven by end-user Service Level Agreements (SLAs)? (ii) How many content distribution servers to provision? And (iii) what Cloud VM configuration (number of instances, types, speed, etc.) to provision? In this paper, we present concepts and factors related to engineering such content-driven applications over public Clouds. Based on these concepts and factors, we propose a performance evaluation methodology for quantifying and understanding the runtime configuration of these classes of applications.

Despite of many benefits, a widespread adoption is limited by many issues that potential customers still have to face. Security in the cloud is one of the main concern for the customer. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is responsible of providing security to customers and assuring that their data and application are properly secured. In this context, the concept of Service Level Agreement (SLA) assumes a great importance. It can be used as a means to formalize and establish in a contract what must effectively be granted in terms of security levels. There is actually Semantic Gap between how security guarantees are intended respectively by customers and providers. A customer is inclined to express security in terms of high-level requirements, while a CSP expresses guarantees through a technical, low-level language. To address this gap, the key is to find a common language for both the customer and the CSP. The goal of this paper is to offer an Ontology-based Negotiation Service allowing a customer to negotiate the interested security level among different CSPs, with the possibility to choose the best security offering; a Security Ontology was developed as a basis for a common semantic language that customers and providers will have to use to express security features and requirements.";;2012;"Liccardo, Loredana; Rak, Massimiliano; Di Modica, Giuseppe & Tomarchio, Orazio";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6412401;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;541;Development of Private Cloud;Cloud computing is a major change, caused by the underlying commoditization of IT.

An effective resource management middleware is necessary to harness the power of the underlying distributed hardware in a cloud. The resource manager needs to be able to effectively perform mapping (matchmaking and scheduling) of user requests (jobs) on to resources to satisfy desired system objectives as well as user's requirements for a quality of service that is often captured in a service level agreement (SLA). This paper concerns the problem of meeting an end-to-end SLA (characterized by an earliest start time, an execution time, and a deadline) for applications that require service from multiple resources (referred to as multi-stage applications) on a system subjected to an open stream of request arrivals. A new budget-based algorithm and a resource manager called MapReduce Budget-based Resource Manager (MRBB-RM) are devised for effectively performing matchmaking and scheduling of an open stream of MapReduce jobs (a popular multi-stage application) with SLAs on a distributed environment such as a cloud or a cluster.

Cloud computing services promise elastic computing and storage resources in a pay-as-you-go way. A SLA between a cloud service provider (CSP) and a user is a contract which specifies the resources and performances that the cloud should offer. However, the CSP has the incentive to cheat on SLA, e.g., providing users with less CPU and memory resources than that specified in the SLA, which allows the CSP to support more users and make more profits. A malicious CSP can disrupt the existing SLA monitoring/verification techniques by interfering the monitoring/measurement process. Therefore, we present a SLA verification framework that leverages a third party auditor (TPA). Under the TPA framework, we propose an effective testing algorithm that can detect SLA violations of physical memory size in virtual machine (VM). Using real experiments, we show that the algorithm can detect cloud cheating on VM memory size (i.e., SLA violations). Furthermore, our algorithm can defend various attacks from a malicious CSP, which tries to hide a SLA violation.;;2012;"Lin Ye; Hongli Zhang; Jiantao Shi & Xiaojiang Du";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6503207;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;544;Cloud Computing Titel: Cloud-based Parallel Computing for Unstructured Information Processing Reference;Nowadays, the increasing amount of collaboratively created content is hardly accessible for analysis with traditional technology because it is normally unstructured information.

Based on such a 2D CAD model, the data points are directly converted into RP slice data and fed to an RP machine for fabricating. In this process, neither a surface model nor a STL file is generated. This is accomplished from the 3D data points in several steps: first, the cloud data are sliced into a number of layers along a user-specified direction. The points in each layer are projected onto a plane. Secondly, the points on each plane are sorted and compressed. Data point smoothing is then carried out using a discrete curvature based method. Thirdly, a local interpolating method is used for adding additional points to the slice-lines having insufficient points. Fourthly, the cross-sections between every two neighbouring planes are created by directly connecting the feature points (FPs) with straight-line segments.

In this FCS paradigm, users submit distributed computing ""jobs"" to a service provider called FCSP, and the FCSP will try to complete the jobs using its own computing and optical networking resources (or resources that belong to a third party for which the FCSP is a broker). FCS may be considered as the future generation of Cloud Computing as FCS is capable of integrating more computing and networking resources, and providing a stronger Service Level Agreements (SLAs) than existing ones. In this dissertation, we have focused on the case where each job requires both distributed computing facilities for concurrent processing in a networked computing environment, and high-bandwidth networking resources to support communications or data exchanges among these distributed computing facilities.The FCS paradigm is suitable for both types of distributed computing jobs or applications: virtual infrastructure (VI) and Workflow (WF). A VI job is usually represented by an undirected graph, which specifies a set of computing resources and their connectivity required to run a set of computing tasks for a specific period of time. On the other hand, a WF job can be represented using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where directed edges also imply precedence among the tasks. Depending on the bandwidth requirements of communications, computing clusters are connected using dedicated circuits with either wavelength or sub-wavelength granularities, or by opportunistically reserving bandwidth between them. Both the distributed computing facilities (for the execution of tasks) and high-bandwidth networking resources (for the communication between tasks) will be reserved in advance for a limited period of time specified by the job description. Subject to the above constraints, the primary challenge of supporting these applications is to find an optimal mapping from the task graph (an overlay) to the substrate network such as aWDM network connecting many computing clusters. For each accepted job request, the set of clusters chosen to execute the tasks, and the lightpaths established among them during the task execution, together form what we call an Application Specific and Agile Private (ASAP) network.The main research issues addressed in this dissertation include the following: (1) Design and analyze SLA-driven cost-effective task assignment and scheduling algorithms; (2) Develop survivable approaches based on joint optimization of computing and networking resources; (3) Study advanced topics related to the impact/tradeoffs of traffic grooming, optical circuit switching (OCS) vs optical burst switching (OBS), programmable nodes, (4) Use analysis and simulations to evaluate the proposed solutions.";;2009;Liu, Xin;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1751395;State University of New York at Buffalo;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;556;Optimal Design for Cloud Infrastructure in Multi-layer Service Computing Environment;Cloud infrastructure should accommodate changing demands for different types of transactions with heterogeneous requests workload and response time constraints.

As with other cloud-based services, database services may enjoy cost efficiency through consolidation: hosting multiple databases within a single physical server. Aggressive consolidation, however, may hurt the service quality, leading to SLA violation penalty, which in turn reduces the total business profit, called SLA profit. In this paper, we consider the problem of tenant placement in the cloud for SLA profit maximization, which, as will be shown in the paper, is strongly NP-hard. We propose SLA profit-aware solutions for database tenant placement based on our model for expected penalty computation for multitenant servers.

Cloud providers promise to reduce the costs while guaranteeing always a good performance for the outsourced services. A reducing of the costs can be achieved by a better utilization of the resources for example. To optimize resource utilization while complying to the negotiated Service Level Agreements, the minimum amount of resources has to be determined as exactly as possible.

On the one hand, the problem could be framed as a global optimization that aims to minimize some notion of system-wide (social) cost. On the other hand, the problem could be framed in a game-theoretic setting whereby rational, selfish users compete for a share of the resources so as to maximize their private utilities with little or no regard for system-wide objectives. This game-theoretic setting is particularly applicable to emerging cloud and grid environments, testbed platforms, and many networking applications. This thesis considers both perspectives.By adopting the first, global optimization perspective, this thesis presents NETEM-BED: a framework, associated mechanisms, and implementations that enable the mapping of requested configurations to available infrastructure resources.By adopting the second, game-theoretic perspective, this thesis defines and establishes the premises of two resource acquisition mechanisms: ""Colocation Games"" and ""Trade and Cap"". Colocation Games enable the modeling and analysis of the dynamics that result when rational, selfish parties interact in an attempt to minimize the individual costs they incur to secure shared resources necessary to support their application QoS or SLA requirements. Trade and Cap is a market-based scheduling and load-balancing mechanism that facilitates the trading of resources when users have a mixture of rigid and fluid jobs, and incentivizes users to behave in ways that result in better load-balancing of shared resources. In addition to developing their analytical underpinnings, this thesis establishes the viability of NetEmbed, Colocation Games, and Trade and Cap by presenting implementation blueprints and experimental results for many variants of these mechanisms.The results presented in this thesis pave the way for the development of economically-sound resource acquisition and management solutions in two emerging, and increasingly important settings. In pay-as-you-go settings, where pricing is based on usage, this thesis anticipates new service offerings that enable efficient marketplaces in the presence of non-cooperative, selfish agents. In settings where pricing is not a function of usage, this thesis anticipates the development of service offerings that enable trading of usage rights to maximize the utility of a shared infrastructure to its tenants.";;2010;Londono Pelaez, Jorge Mario;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1970797;Boston University;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;561;Air temperature and soil phosphorus availability correlate with trait differences between two types of tropical cloud forests;Tropical cloud forests are characterized by lower air temperature and high frequency of fog condensation at canopy level, as compared with forests at lower altitudes. Few studies have been conducted to understand differences of plant functional traits in relation to the environment in this kind of forest. In this paper, we explored the community-level differences of specific leaf area (SLA) and height of plants in relation to major environmental conditions between two adjacent tropical cloud forests on Hainan Island, South China. We measured the two functional traits for all individual plants within twenty-nine and thirty-two 10m_10m plots located in a low altitude tropical montane evergreen forest (TMEF) and a high altitude tropical dwarf forest (TDF), respectively. The results showed that both mean SLA and height decreased from TMEF to TDF, while phenotypic plasticity for the two functional traits increased from TMEF to TDF. Correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the mean SLA and its plasticity were significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus. The mean height was only significantly correlated with air temperature, but its plasticity was significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus. Our results suggest that plants in dwarf tropical cloud forests have decreased SLA and height, correlated with less favorable soil and atmospheric conditions, with a higher plasticity of these traits, as compared with the tropical montane evergreen forest.

The new cloud-computing paradigm is stressing the concept of the governance of relationship between IT customers and providers. The relationship is based on Service Level Agreements (SLA) and obligations, described inside contracts between providers and customers. Every customer needs to agree with a SLA in order to lease a new service. SLAs describe provisioning terms and encapsulate QoS characteristics as well as functional properties. Traditionally, providers define SLAs in which they guarantee explicit provisioning service level bounds for an agreed period. In the scientific literature, SLAs are hardly viewed as end-user documents, and merely as automated processes that assist the monitoring and scheduling of resources. In contrast, cloud IT marketplaces treat SLAs as static documents that do not allow for any processing. Moreover, strong diversity exists in how service providers coming from distinct business and socio-economical domains formulate and exercise their provisioning responsibilities. Such issues need to be resolved in order to make SLAs enacting tools for managers and services' providers in order to govern contracts. The contribution of this paper is to discuss some relevant open issues not covered by current contract management approaches and tools. In particular we will explore how service composition, with specific focus on service levels, limits and shapes technical, legal and organizational aspects related to the contract of the composed service.;;2013;"Longo, Antonella; Bochicchio, Mario A. & Livieri, Barbara";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2536146.2536153;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;563;VM scaling based on Hurst exponent and Markov transition with empirical cloud data;One of the major benefits of cloud computing is virtualization scaling. Compared to existing studies on virtual machine scaling, this paper introduces Hurst exponent which gives additional characteristics for data trends to supplement the often used Markov transition approach. This approach captures both the long and short-term behaviors of the virtual machines (VMs). The dataset for testing of this approach was gathered from the computer usage of key servers supporting a large university. Performance evaluation shows our approach can assist prediction of VM CPU usage toward effective resource allocation. In turn, this allows the cloud resource provider to monitor and allocate the resource usage of all VMs in order to meet the service level agreements for each VM client.;;2014;"Lu, Chien-Tung; Chang, Chia-Wei & Li, Jung-Shian";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121214002155;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;564;QoS-aware SLA-based Advanced Reservation of Infrastructure as a Service;Cloud computing effectively implements the vision of utility computing by employing a pay-as-you-go cost model and allowing on-demand (re-)leasing of IT resources. Small or medium-sized Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, however, find it challenging to satisfy all requests immediately due to their limited resource capacity. In that situation, both providers and customers may benefit greatly from advanced reservation of virtual resources, i.e. virtual machines. In our work, we assume SLA-based resource requests and introduce an advanced reservation methodology during SLA negotiation by using computational geometry. Thereby, we are able to verify, record and manage the infrastructure resources efficiently. Based on that model, service providers can easily verify the available capacity for satisfying the customer's Quality-of-Service requirements. Furthermore, we introduce flexible alternative counter-offers, when the service provider lacks resources. Therefore, our mechanism increases the utilization of the resources and attempts to satisfy as many customers as possible.;;2011;"Lu, Kuan; Roblitz, Thomas; Yahyapour, Ramin; Yaqub, Edwin & Kotsokalis, Constantinos";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6133155 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2114498.2116221;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;565;Structural optimization of reduced ordered binary decision diagrams for SLA negotiation in iaas of cloud computing;In cloud computing, an automated SLA is an electronic contract used to record the rights and obligations of service providers and customers for their services. SLA negotiation can be a time-consuming process, mainly due to the unpredictable rounds of negotiation and the complicated possible dependencies among SLAs. The operation of negotiating SLAs can be facilitated when SLAs are translated into Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs). Nevertheless, an ROBDD may not be optimally structured upon production. In this paper, we show how to reduce the number of 1-paths and nodes of ROBDDs that model SLAs, using ROBDD optimization algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate the reduction of 1-paths via the application of Term Rewriting Systems with mutually exclusive features. Using the latter, ROBDDs can be generated accurately without redundant 1-paths. We apply the principles onto the negotiation of IaaS SLAs via simulation, and show that negotiation is accelerated by assessing fewer SLA proposals (1-paths), while memory consumption is also reduced.;;2012;"Lu, Kuan; Yahyapour, Ramin; Yaqub, Edwin & Kotsokalis, Constantinos";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2426136.2426160;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;566;Towards a Novel Web Services Standard-Supported CDN-P2P Loosely-Coupled Hybrid and Management Model;In recent years, some researchers have begun to focus on researching CDN-P2P-hybrid architecture, but most hybrid architectures belong to tightly-coupled hybrid model. Cloud computing era calls for a more open content service mode. In order to construct open service relationship, we propose one novel CDN-P2P loosely-coupled SLA negotiation model. CDN firstly needs to provide an open and standard-based agreement interface for the P2P and other applications to negotiate with it. Therefore, we use Web Services Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) for establishing agreement between two CDN and P2P. This scheme also allows CDN easily integrated with other application. The loosely-coupled CDN-P2P-SLA establishment needs to link with SLA performance monitoring, we design WSDM based CDN-P2P loosely coupled SLA monitoring scheme.

Unfortunately, it is quite uncommon for a CSP to specify the security levels associated with their services, hence impeding users from making security relevant informed decisions. Consequently, while the many economic and technological advantages of Cloud computing are apparent, the migration of key sector applications has been limited, in part, due to the lack of security assurance on the CSP. In order to achieve this assurance and create trustworthy Cloud ecosystems, it is desirable to develop metrics and techniques to compare, aggregate, negotiate and predict the trade-offs (features, problems and the economics) of security. This paper contributes with a quantitative security assessment case study using the CSP information found on the Cloud Security Alliance’s Security, Trust & Assurance Registry (CSA STAR).

However, the recent efforts on specification of security statements in Service Level Agreements, also known as “Security Level Agreements ” or SecLAs is a positive development. While a consistent notion of Cloud SecLAs is still developing, already some major CSPs are creating and storing their advocated SecLAs in publicly available repositories e.g., the Cloud Security Alliance’s “Security, Trust & Assurance Registry” (CSA STAR). While several academic and industrial efforts are developing the methods to build and specify Cloud SecLAs, very few works deal with the techniques to quantitatively reason about SecLAs in order to provide security assurance. This paper proposes a method to benchmark – both quantitatively and qualitatively – the Cloud SecLAs of one or more CSPs with respect to a user-defined requirement, also in the form of a SecLA. The contributed security benchmark methodology rests on the notion of Quantitative Policy Trees (QPT), a data structure that we propose to represent and systematically reason about SecLAs. In this paper we perform the initial validation of the contributed methodology with respect to another state of the art proposal, which in turn was empirically validated using the SecLAs stored on the CSA STAR repository.

However, data centers hosting cloud applications consume vast amounts of electrical energy, thereby contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints. Green cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize the operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact are necessary. This study focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service model, where custom virtual machines (VMs) are launched in appropriate servers available in a data center. A complete data center resource management scheme is presented in this paper. The scheme can not only ensure user quality of service (through service level agreements) but can also achieve maximum energy saving and green computing goals. Considering that the data center host is usually tens of thousands in size and that using an exact algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem is difficult, the modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm and improved extremal optimization are employed in this study to solve the dynamic allocation problem of VMs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed resource management scheme exhibits excellent performance in green cloud computing.;;2014;"Luo, Jian-ping; Li, Xia & Chen, Min-rong";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414001778;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;571;Enhanced geolocation of spaceborne laser altimeter surface returns: parameter calibration from the simultaneous reduction of altimeter range and navigation tracking data;The accurate geolocation of a laser altimeter’s surface return, the spot from which the laser energy reflects on the Earth’s surface, is a critical issue in the scientific application of these data. Pointing, ranging, timing and orbit errors must be compensated to accurately geolocate these data. Detailed laser altimeter measurement models have been developed and implemented within precision orbit determination software providing the capability to simultaneously estimate the orbit and geolocation parameters from a combined reduction of altimeter range and spacecraft tracking data. In preparation for NASA’s future dedicated Earth observing spaceborne laser altimeter missions, the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) and the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), data from two Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA) missions have been reprocessed to test and refine these algorithms and to develop the analysis methodologies for the production and verification of enhanced geolocation products. Both direct altimetry and dynamic crossover data have been reduced in combination with navigation tracking data to obtain significant improvement in SLA geolocation accuracy. Residual and overlap precision tests indicate a factor of two improvement over the previously released SLA Standard Data Products, showing 40-m RMS horizontal and 26-cm RMS elevation geolocation precision for the long SLA-01 arcs. Accuracy estimates by comparing SLA profiles to Digital Elevation Models show horizontal positioning accuracy at the 60-m (1$\sigma$) level. Vertical accuracies, on the order of 1 m (1$\sigma$) for low slope surfaces are now dominated by the ±75-cm one-way range resolution of the instrument. Comparable relative improvements are also observed in the analysis of the SLA-02 data. The analyses show that complex temporal variations in parameters (i.e., pointing) can be recovered and not just simple biases.

To properly geolocate the surface returns it will be necessary to verify and calibrate pointing, ranging, timing and orbit parameters once the instrument is in orbit. In preparation for these spacborne lidar missions, detailed algorithms and methodologies have been developed and tested to precisely geolocate the surface returns.

We extract resource candidates depending on user requirements and allocate a job to the most suitable candidate for an agreed Service Level Agreement (SLA). The cloud ontology allows the proposed system to define concepts and describe their relations. Hence, we can process complicated queries for searching cloud resources.

The terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) to be provided as well as the economic conditions are established in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). The common objective of a Cloud provider is to maximize its economic profit. However, there are situations in which providers must differentiate the SLAs with respect to the type of client that is willing to access the resources or the agreed QoS, e.g. when the hardware resources are shared between users of the company that own the resources and external users. This article proposes two sets of policies to manage SLAs with respect to the business objectives of a Cloud provider: Revenue Maximization or classification of clients.

Further deployed cloud workloads must be easily updatable, scalable and be monitored. In order to address these issues, IPAS captures the workload in special reusable packages called Virtual Application Pattern (VAP) and Virtual System Pattern (VSP) which not only abstracts and encapsulates the images, but also provides expert knowledge to tailor the workload based on user requirements.

Recent research investigates the problem of minimizing the number of servers required to host a set of tenants when the working sets of tenants are kept in main memory (e.g., in-memory OLAP workloads, or OLTP workloads), thus the memory assigned to each tenant, as well as the I/O bandwidth and CPU time, are all dictated by the working set size of the tenant. Other research investigates the reverse problem when the number of servers is fixed, but the amount of resources allocated to different tenants on the same server needs to be configured to optimize a cost function. In this paper we investigate the problem when neither the number of servers nor the amount of resources allocated to each tenant are fixed. This problem arises when consolidating OLAP workloads of tenants whose service-level agreements (SLAs) allow for queries to be answered from disk. We study the trade-off between the amount of memory and the I/O bandwidth assigned to OLAP workloads, and develop a principled approach for allocating resources to tenants in a manner that minimizes the total number of servers required to host all tenants while satisfying the SLA of each tenant.

This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, Cloud computing is defined and the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation are provided by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). Also insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational have been provided.Cloud computing customers generally do not own the physical infrastructure, instead avoiding capital expenditure by renting usage from a third-party provider. They consume resources as a service and pay only for resources that they use. Many cloud-computing offerings employ the utility computing model, which is analogous to how traditional utility services (such as electricity) are consumed, while others bill on a subscription basis. Sharing ""perishable and intangible"" computing power among multiple tenants can improve utilization rates, as servers are not unnecessarily left idle (which can reduce costs significantly while increasing the speed of application development). A side effect of this approach is that overall computer usage rises dramatically, as customers do not have to engineer for peak load limits. Additionally, ""increased high-speed bandwidth"" makes it possible to receive the same response times from centralized infrastructure at other sites.

Green computing implies that the ICT industry has become a significant energy consumer and consequently, a major source of CO2 emissions. Cloud computing makes it possible to purchase IT resources as a service without upfront costs. In this paper, the combination of these two trends, green cloud computing, will first be evaluated based on existing research findings, which indicate that private clouds are the most green option to offer services. Hosting of private clouds can be outsourced, which allows companies to focus on their core competences. Furthermore, three case studies of state-of-the-art companies offering green hosting services are presented and incentives affecting their energy-efficiency development are analyzed. The results reveal that currently there is no demand in the market for green hosting services, because the only incentive for companies is low costs. Service providers should illustrate their greenness with transparent efficiency metrics, draw up green service level agreements and compete with greenness.

We present a thorough experimental study of consolidated n-tier application performance at high utilization to address this issue through reproducible measurements. Our experimental method illustrates opportunities for increasing operational efficiency by making consolidated application performance more predictable in high utilization scenarios. The main focus of this paper are non-trivial dependencies between SLA-critical response time degradation effects and software configurations (i.e., readily available tuning knobs). Methodologically, we directly measure and analyze the resource utilizations, request rates, and performance of two consolidated n-tier application benchmark systems (RUBBoS) in an enterprise-level computer virtualization environment. We find that monotonically increasing the workload of an n-tier application system may unexpectedly spike the overall response time of another co-located system by 300 percent despite stable throughput. Based on these findings, we derive a software configuration best-practice to mitigate such non-monotonic response time variations by enabling higher request-processing concurrency (e.g., more threads) in all tiers.

With the growth of the Internet and online services, the number of data centers is increasing day by day. Servers for many cloud applications and other large providers are spread globally. Energy costs across the globe vary dynamically. Servers operate at varied energy costs based on their location and time of use. The load of a server varies based on its geographical location and the time of operation. This paper focuses on exploiting the dynamic nature of electrical power pricing, so that a cost saving is obtained by geo-location of requests to servers operating at lower costs at particular times. There exist patterns of load that are similar for different types of servers. Scheduling decisions are made considering both loads and operating costs of the servers into account, i. e., requests are scheduled to run on servers operating at low cost that also have low expected load. In order to meet the business requirements of an application, scheduling decisions for requests that have stringent SLA considerations or high server affinity, are made by assigning high priority for these requests. Geo-location of requests is done for low priority requests.;;2011;Mani, Sudha & Rao, Shrisha;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1980422.1980434;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;589;Digital forensics in the Cloud Computing Era;Cloud Computing (CC) is a promising next-generation computing paradigm providing network and computing resources on demand via the web.

IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Also, when coupled with IoT, cloud computing can in turn deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner. As the cloud market becomes more open and competitive, Quality of Service (QoS) will be more important. However, cloud providers and cloud consumers have different, and sometimes opposite, preferences. If such a conflict occurs, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) cannot be reached without negotiation. A tradeoff negotiation approach can outperform a concession approach in terms of utility, but may incur more failures if information is incomplete. To balance utility and success rate, we propose a mixed approach for cloud service negotiation, which is based on the “game of chicken.” In particular, if one is uncertain about the strategy of its counterpart, it is best to mix concession and tradeoff strategies in negotiation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive simulations. Results show that a mixed negotiation approach can achieve a higher utility than a concession approach, while incurring fewer failures than a tradeoff approach.;;2014;Martin, Patrick & Brohman, Kathryn;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6746014;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;592;Profit Maximization for Service Providers using Hybrid Pricing in Cloud Computing;"Cloud computing has recently emerged as one of the buzzwords in the IT industry.

Lately, many of these networks are migrating to the cloud for its numerous advantages such as lower costs, increased performance, availability and flexibility in installing new resources. This paper introduces a new approach towards load balancing as well as power reduction in cloud-based content delivery networks allowing for a controlled scaling of operational parameters within the tradeoff between power consumption and quality of experience (QoE). By applying a new proposed adaptive server activation/ deactivation model at each data center in the cloud, unutilized servers at the data center can be switched off to reduce the power consumption. This adaptive model also allows the data center to maintain its performance while being utilized up to 95\%. Performance measures of data centers are crucial as there are certain user service level agreements (SLA) for the cloud subscribers that should not be violated; most important is the latency for users' requests. The proposed load balancing algorithm benefits from limited latency for requests by only shifting the load off a data center when it is almost fully loaded. When the load in a data center exceeds a critical level, processes are migrated to underloaded data centers within the cloud.

A Service Level Agreement (SLA), which is established between a Cloud provider and a customer, specifies these requirements. It includes terms like required memory consumption, bandwidth or service availability. The SLA also defines penalties for SLA violations when the Cloud provider fails to provide the agreed amount of resources or quality of service. A current challenge in Cloud environments is to detect any possible SLA violation and to timely react upon it to avoid paying penalties, as well as reduce unnecessary resource consumption by managing resources more efficiently. In resource-shared Cloud environments, where there might be multiple VMs on a single physical machine and multiple applications on a single VM, Cloud providers require mechanisms for monitoring resource and QoS metrics for each customer application separately. Currently, there is a lack of generic classification of application level metrics. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for classifying and monitoring application level metrics in a resource-shared Cloud environment. We present the design and implementation of the generic application level monitoring system.

On the one hand, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that defines QoS goals for arbitrary parameters between the Cloud provider and the customer should not be violated. On the other hand, the Cloud providers aim to maximize their profit, where optimizing resource usage is an important part. In this paper we develop a simulation engine that mimics the control cycle of an autonomic manager to evaluate different knowledge management techniques (KM) feasible for efficient resource management and SLA attainment.

To achieve this we start from Autonomic Computing, examine the autonomic control loop and adapt it to govern Cloud Computing infrastructures. We first hierarchically structure all possible adaptation actions into so-called escalation levels. We then focus on one of these levels by analyzing monitored data from virtual machines and making decisions on their resource configuration with the help of knowledge management (KM). The monitored data stems both from synthetically generated workload categorized in different workload volatility classes and from a real-world scenario: scientific workflow applications in bioinformatics. As KM techniques, we investigate two methods, Case-Based Reasoning and a rule-based approach. We design and implement both of them and evaluate them with the help of a simulation engine.

To achieve these goals we propose a novel approach with escalation levels to divide all possible actions into five levels. These levels range from changing the configuration of VMs over migrating them to other PMs to outsourcing applications to other Cloud providers.

Thereby, workload volatility (WV) is one of the crucial factors that influence the quality of suggested allocations. In this paper we devise a novel approach for self-adaptive and resource-efficient decision-making considering the three conflicting goals of minimizing the number of SLA violations, maximizing resource utilization, and minimizing the number of necessary time- and energy-consuming reconfiguration actions. We propose self-adaptive rule-based knowledge management for autonomic VM reconfiguration considering the rapidness of changes in the workload, i.e., WV. We introduce a novel WV categorization and present cost and volatility based methods for self-tuning.

Restricting the number of different resource types to a small set of standardized computing resources seems to be the appropriate solution to counteract this problem. Standardized computing resources are defined through an SLA template. An SLA template defines the structure of an SLA, the service attributes, the names of the service attributes, and the service attribute values. However, since existing research results have only introduced static SLA templates so far, the SLA templates cannot reflect changes in user needs and market structures. To address this shortcoming, we present a novel approach of adaptive SLA matching. This approach adapts SLA templates based on SLA mappings of users. It allows Cloud users to define mappings between a public SLA template, which is available in the Cloud market, and their private SLA templates, which are used for various in-house business processes of the Cloud user. Besides showing how public SLA templates are adapted to the demand of Cloud users, we also analyze the costs and benefits of this approach. Costs are incurred every time a user has to define a new SLA mapping to a public SLA template due to its adaptation. In particular, we investigate how the costs differ with respect to the public SLA template adaptation method. The simulation results show that the use of heuristics within adaptation methods allows balancing the costs and benefits of the SLA mapping approach.;;2012;"Maurer, Michael; Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Brandic, Ivona & Altmann, J\""{o}rn";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2304777.2304870 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X11001051;Elsevier Science Publishers B.

The resource allocation for each VM is defined by the user and the VM is created on a physical machine where ample resources exist to support the VMs operation at the maximum expected load. There are a number of opportunities for improvement when allocating host resources to VMs. VM-resident applications are often n-tier, with different VMs responsible for parts of the distributed application. The network proximity to the user may be an issue for some applications. Resource allocation to VMs should also be such that, rather than a user over-provisioning the VM, the VMs minimal operational requirements are specified so that the VM can be resource-throttled at times of heavy load. This paper presents a system called Innkeeper, a three-tiered distributed approach which aims to dynamically allocate resources to VMs in a way that ensures SLA compliance, with consideration given to the network conditions between related VMs. Initial experiments show that the InnKeeper framework provides a means of real-time, SLA-compliant allocation of distributed cloud resources.;excluded;2012;"McConnell, Aaron; Parr, Gerard; McClean, Sally; Morrow, Philip & Scotney, Bryan";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6483653;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;608;Dynamic cloud service topology adaption for minimizing resources while meeting performance goals;Even in the cloud computing era, meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) of a computing service or application while significantly reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) remains a challenge.

Even where similar problems are addressed, each individual research team evaluates proposed algorithms under distinct conditions, using various techniques, often targeted to a small collection of VMs and PMs. In this paper, we describe an objective method that can be used to compare VMplacement algorithms in large clouds, covering tens of thousands of PMs and hundreds of thousands of VMs. We demonstrate our method by comparing 18 algorithms for initial VM placement in on-demand infrastructure clouds.

To achieve this goal in automatic manner, a resource scaling mechanism is needed that maintains application performance according to Service Level Agreements (SLA) and reduces resource costs at the same time. In this paper, we present a cross-correlation prediction approach based on machine learning that predicts resource demands of multiple resources of virtual machines running in a cloud infrastructure. Based on these predictions, a proactive resource allocation scheme is applied that assigns only the required resources to virtual machines to keep their cost to a minimum. Experimental results with the web serving multi-tier application benchmark of CloudSuite show the effectiveness of our approach compared to a non-cross-correlation prediction technique in achieving better prediction accuracy and better application performance.;;2014;Minarolli, Dorian & Freisleben, Bernd;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2678832.2678926;IEEE Computer Society;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;616;Revenue Maximization for Cloud Computing Environment through Resource Sharing by SLA;Cloud computing is receiving a great demand among the budding and old enterprises depending on various Information Technology Services in the present IT Scenario. Cloud provides various services which mostly depend upon a good decision making process to handle various requests from service consumers. The Cloud users are mostly divided into two premium or priority and basic users. As far as priority users are concerned the resources are reserved well in advance and it shows a strong negotiation between the service providers and end users. If there is lack of resources the provider has to pay some reimbursement to the user as per the agreement called as Service Level Agreement (SLA), whereas the elementary user gets the service but has to make more than the premium user. In this case providers always attempt is made to reduce the repayment and maximize the revenue. Here the goal of our paper is to achieve the service pooling mechanism with an energy-aware allocation method in PAAS model to save the overall expenses. Experimental outcomes in the proposed research also demonstrate how the projected outline is able to handle cost, revenue, penalty and efficient server utilization for cloud services.;;;"Mishra, Asish; Butt, Muheet Ahmed & Zaman, Majid";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.302.8798;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;617;GUEST EDITORIAL CLOUD COMPUTING: NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATION CHALLENGES;;excluded;;"Mishra, Amitabh; Jain, Raj & Durresi, Arjan";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.302.9883;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;618;Learning Automata-Based QoS Framework for Cloud IaaS;This paper presents a Learning Automata (LA)-based QoS (LAQ) framework capable of addressing some of the challenges and demands of various cloud applications.

Service provisioning can only be guaranteed by continuously monitoring the resource and quantifying various QoS metrics, so that services can be delivered in an on-demand basis with certain levels of guarantee. The proposed framework helps in ensuring guarantees with these metrics in order to provide QoS-enabled cloud services.

Very often, services advertised by different commercial providers are comparable in terms of offered features (both functional and non-functional) and price. We believe the lack of interoperability among cloud platforms is the main cause for this panorama of flattened cloud offers. Luckily, many initiatives are working at the definition of specifications that, once successfully adopted, will open up a new scenario of interoperable clouds. In that scenario, cloud providers will have to diversify their offerings in order to serve the widest possible range of customers' request, customers, in their turn, will be able to choose, from a large assortment of services, those fitting their specific needs. In this work we address these issues by proposing a semantic discovery framework to support providers in creating and advertising their augmented offers, and to help customers making fine-tuned cloud service searches. Final objective is to implement an offer-demand matchmaking process capable of maximizing providers' and customers' utility. To enable mechanisms capable of reasoning on the actual requests' needs and offers' features, ontologies have been defined that describe the cloud context from a business point of view. In particular, guarantees offered by SLAs are the key business features put under the focus of this work.

With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, this pool of users are now more global than any-time in the past The resource demand of these users are inadvertently governed by strict “service level agreements”. In this paradigm, data centers' operational energy costs are a rising concern as they continue an upward trend that is poised to surpass the capital cost of equipment in a typical lifetime usage model. A data center is a complex distributed system comprised of a hierarchy of numerous components; and operating at multitude levels of usage abstractions. Virtualization is an approach to consolidating multiple services onto a smaller number of computing resources. A virtualized server environment allows computing resources to be shared among multiple performance-isolated platforms called virtual machines. Virtual Machine(VM) technology has been widely applied in data center environments due to its seminal features, including reliability, flexibility, and the ease of management. We define set of service-provider controllable policies comprising of number of physical servers, possible number of VMs, possible VM request queue length and maximum number of requests per VM threshold. For each of these defined policy, we implement a dynamic resource provisioning framework for virtualized server environment which achieves power efficiency by using optimum power efficient allocation and workload forecasting scheme to ensure that workload request meet the defined SLAs and the data center operates with least power consumption.

These are normally composed of large and power consuming data centers to provide the required elasticity and scalability to their customers. In this context, many efforts have been developed to balance the loads at host level. However, determining how to maximize the resources utilization at Virtual Machine (VM) level still remains as a big challenge. This is mainly driven by very dynamic workload behaviors and a wide variety of customers' resource utilization patterns. This paper introduces a dynamic resource provisioning mechanism to overallocate the capacity of real-time Cloud data centers based on customer utilization patterns. Furthermore, its impact on the trade-off between energy efficiency and SLA fulfillment is analyzed. The main idea is to exploit the resource utilization patterns of each customer to decrease the waste produced by resource request overestimations. This creates the opportunity to allocate additional VMs in the same host incrementing its energy efficiency. Nevertheless, this also increases the risk of QoS affectations. The proposed model considers SLA deadlines, predictions based on historical data, and dynamic occupation to determine the amount of resources to overallocate for each host. In addition, a compensation mechanism to adjust resource allocation in cases of underestimation is also described. In order to evaluate the model, simulation experimentation was conducted. Results demonstrate meaningful improvements in energy-efficiency while SLA-deadlines are slightly impacted. However, they also point the importance of strongest compensation policies to reduce availability violations especially during peak utilization periods.;;2011;Moreno, Ismael Solis & Xu, Jie;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6166239 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2195215.2195278;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;631;Open computing infrastructures for elastic services;In the future of corporate IT, companies will rely on highly dynamic distributed IT infrastructures.

Some of these characteristics are related to QoS requirements and announced to service provider through SLAs. But some of them are unknown for service provider and selfish users are not interested to reveal them truly. Most the works in literature ignore considering such characteristics and treat users just based on SLA parameters. So, two users with different characteristics but similar SLAs have equal importance for the service provider. In this paper, we use two user's hidden characteristics, named willingness to pay for service and willingness to pay for certainty, to present a new proactive resource allocation approach with aim of decreasing impact of SLA violations. New methods based on learning automaton for estimation of these characteristics are provided as well. To validate our approach we conducted some numerical simulations in critical situations.

As a result, multiple virtual machines (VMs) simultaneously run on each datacenter platform.

This paper proposes the use of shared resource monitoring to (a) understand the resource usage of each virtual machine on each platform, (b) collect resource usage and performance across different platforms to correlate implications of usage to performance, and (c) migrate VMs that are resource-constrained to improve overall datacenter throughput and improve Quality of Service (QoS). We focus our efforts on monitoring and addressing shared cache contention and propose a new optimization metric that captures the priority of the VM and the overall weighted throughput of the datacenter. We conduct detailed experiments emulating datacenter scenarios including on-line transaction processing workloads (based on TPC-C) middle-tier workloads (based on SPECjbb and SPECjAppServer) and financial workloads (based on PARSEC).

To address this problem, we introduce in this work a new MMOG ecosystem for hosting and provisioning of MMOGs which effectively splits the traditional monolithic MMOG companies into three main service providers: game providers, game operators, and resource providers. Their interaction is regulated through comprehensive service level agreements (SLA) that establish the price, terms of operation, and compensation for service violations. In our model, game operators efficiently provision resources for MMOGs from multiple cloud providers, based on dynamic load forecasts, and ensure proper game operation that maintains the required QoS to all clients under varying resource availability. Game providers manage multiple distributed MMOGs for which they lease services under strict operational SLAs from game operators to satisfy all client requests. These three self-standing, smaller, more agile service providers enable access to the MMOG market for the small and medium enterprises, and to the current commercial cloud providers. We evaluate, through simulations based on real-life MMOG traces and commercial cloud SLAs, the impact of resource availability on the QoS offered to the MMOG clients. We find that our model can mitigate the negative effects of resource failures within four minutes and that MMOG server consolidation can accentuate the negative effects of failures in a resource-scarce environment. We further investigate different methods of ranking MMOG operational offers with either single or multiple (competing) MMOG providers. Our results show that compensations for SLA faults in the offer selection process can lead up to 11---16 % gain in the game providers' income. We also demonstrate that adequate ranking of offers can lead to MMOG operational cost reductions from 20 up to 60 %.;;2014;"Nae, Vlad; Prodan, Radu & Iosup, Alexandru";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2673677.2673692;Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;643;Autonomic operation of massively multiplayer online games in clouds;To support the variable load of Massively Multiplayer On-line Games (MMOGs) with millions of registered users and thousands of active concurrent players, game operators over-provision a large static infrastructure capable of sustaining the peak load with guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS).

While elastic resource requirements of a cloud service user often exhibit periodic patterns, the absence of a mechanism to specify precisely the elastic resource requirements forces the cloud service provider to either provision unbounded resources or offer services with rigid and static resources, none of which is an efficient or economic proposition to the tenant. We propose, in this paper, a novel model of dynamic service level agreement (SLA) for the tenants to specify their elastic resource requirements so that the cloud service provider can take an informed decision for resource management, thereby optimizing on resource utilization, user expenses and generated revenue. We study the problem from a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) perspective. We propose an intuitive model of dynamic SLA that can capture the anticipated license requirement variation of an SaaS user. We also propose ILP and greedy-heuristic based optimization approaches for the service provider to solve the tenant on-boarding problem with dynamic SLA constraints. Experimental results show that our solution produces optimal or near-optimal (for heuristic based approach) performance in terms of overall resource utilization and the economy for both the service provider and the tenants.;;2013;"Nandi, B.B.; Banerjee, A.; Ghosh, S.C. & Banerjee, N.";;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;648;Fault Tolerance as a Service;Cloud computing is fast emerging as a popular choice for a variety of business needs. Providing adequate fault tolerance guarantees to diverse applications is an important challenge. Fault tolerance needs vary from one application to another. Fault tolerance consumes resources. In this paper, we propose fault tolerance to be added as a service, termed here as FTaaS, which can provide both spatial and temporal redundancies. A tenant (who seeks fault tolerance services) can express its intended fault tolerance level as part of the Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we investigate a general setting, where a tenant can execute in different modes, with different fault tolerance criterion. The task of a provider (who sells fault tolerance services) is to configure his offerings in accordance to the tenants' requirements, in a way which keeps his customers satisfied and his revenue is maximized. We consider several variations of this problem in the paper. We also discuss the other side of the tenant-provider setting, wherein a tenant has multiple providers to choose from, keeping in mind the requirements he has and the cost he has to pay to avail the services.

Elastic cloud computing enables services to be deployed and accessed globally on demand with little maintenance by providing QoS as per service level agreement (SLA) of customer. The Cloud-based DDoS attacks or outside DDoS attacks can make ostensibly legitimate requests for a service to generate an economic Distributed Denial of Service (eDDoS) - where the elastic nature of the cloud allows scaling of service beyond the economic means of the purveyor to pay their cloud-based service bills which leads to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS). Attacks mimicking legitimate users are on the climb. For cloud computing to remain attractive, the DDoS threat is to be addressed before it triggers the billing mechanism.

This race between the needs to increase both the cloud upgrade frequency and the service availability is unsustainable. In this paper we highlight challenges and opportunities for upgrades in the cloud. We survey the release histories of several cloud applications to analyze their evolution pace, and we discuss the shortcomings with current cloud upgrade mechanisms.

To change the schema, the application has to be shut down and migrated to the new version, or run in a mixed mode that supports old and new clients, e.g., via schema versioning. Shutdowns are problematic for applications that cannot tolerate downtime such as embedded, real-time or missioncritical systems; in the Cloud, shutdowns can lead to Service Level Agreement violations or worse, to service interruptions for critical platforms such as healthcare. Mixed-mode operation raises programmability, consistency and performance degradation issues. In this paper we present a system that exploits the march-forward nature of many database applications (no need to support old schema versions after the schema update) to provide on-the-fly updates while ensuring consistency, and being transparent to clients. We first study schema evolution and database usage based on longitudinal studies of four popular open source applications. Next, we implement support for safe on-the-fly schema updates on top of the popular SQLite database engine. Finally, we evaluate our approach using real-world schema changes and database usage scenarios for applications running in the Cloud on the Amazon Web Services platform, and on server systems. We show how on-the-fly schema updates can increase Cloud applications ’ availability from less than two nines (99%) to more than six nines (99.9999%).

The use of server virtualization techniques for such platforms provide great flexibility with the ability to consolidate several virtual machines on the same physical server, to resize a virtual machine capacity and to migrate virtual machine across physical servers. A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs.

In multi-tenant distributed and virtualized cloud infrastructures, the enhanced level of resource sharing raises issues in terms of performance stability and reliability of cloud services, threatening the possibility to offer precise service levels in end-to-end scenarios. Technology-wise, we have today some basic building blocks that may enable cloud infrastructures to exhibit stable and predictable performance to customers. However, one of the major obstacles that keep hindering the potential for a worldwide deployment of these technologies, is the fact that, in many distributed and cloud computing scenarios, there is not merely a single business entity responsible for the service delivery, but we may have multiple different, unrelated business entities with contrasting and competing requirements, interacting for the provisioning of end-to-end cloud services to customers and finally end users. It is the case, for example, of multiple cloud providers, storage providers and network service providers, that may be involved for the delivery of a distributed cloud service to a community of end users. In this context, setting up proper Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) among the involved players, for delivering strong QoS guarantees to customers, may become overly challenging. However, the main problems arising in such interactions may be mitigated by a thoughtful intervention of standardization.

In this paper, we introduce a cloud-based message brokering service which allows better scalability and dynamic load balancing between brokers. Our system framework monitors each virtual machine (VM)'s resources and in order to meet the service level agreement (SLA), a VM is rented or recollected automatically by the system. The framework also provides the best available broker that a client can use for connections. Our experimental results show that our system framework can achieve up to 58.60\% of scalability improvement at the maximum number of subscriber connections.;;2011;"Oh, F.Y.-K.; Shin-gyu Kim; Hyeonsang Eom; Yeom, H.Y.; Jongwon Park & Yongwoo Lee";;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;669;Efficient network service level agreement monitoring for cloud computing systems;Cloud computing defines an infrastructure to provide virtual network services on demand. One of the challenges to cloud computing systems is how to manage service level agreements (SLA) while guaranteeing the service level objectives (SLOs) negotiated between provider and customer. Deviations in the expected behavior of network service levels may be generically named traffic anomalies. The awareness of anomalies in cloud services may provide useful information for both customer and provider, in order to support management accounting to their business strategies. In this paper we present a novel approach to monitor and account network SLA deviations by designing a new architecture, as well as implementing and deploying it as an open source engine. It has been integrated into a production middleware to federate clouds, the Jit Clouds. Nevertheless, this monitoring mechanism is loosely coupled, being extensible to any sort of clouds. The architecture proposed was validated on a federated cloud platform in production.;;2014;"Oliveira, Ana Cristina; Chagas, Henryson; Spohn, Marco; Gomes, Reinaldo & Duarte, Breno Jacinto";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6912551;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;670;Cloud Computing: Resource Management and Service Allocation;The increase acceptance and adoption of cloud computing has seen many research projects focusing on tradition distributed computing issues such as resource allocation and performance.

Each service comes with a pricing model and service level agreement (SLA). Today's pricing models and SLAs are described at the level of compute resources (instance-hours or gigabytes processed). They are also different from one service to the next. Both conditions make it difficult for users to select a service, pick a configuration, and predict the actual analysis cost. To address this challenge, we propose a new abstraction, called a Personalized Service Level Agreement, where users are presented with what they can do with their data in terms of query capabilities, guaranteed query performance and fixed hourly prices.;;2013;"Ortiz, Jennifer; De Almeida, Victor Teixeira & Balazinska, Magdalena";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2486767.2486772;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;672;Using strategy trees in change management in clouds;Change management in a cloud environment is often complicated by the different needs of the cloud clients. Changes are not applied all at once. For example, a client may require that a change to the Platform-as-Service (PaaS) instance assigned to it must only be done on the weekend while another client allows for the change to be done at any time. The time periods at which changes can be applied may be specified in SLAs. A change deployment schedule for making changes to PaaS instances often depends on the cloud provider policies and on the SLAs between the clients and the cloud provider. Different sets of cloud provider policies may result in different deployment schedules. Changes are not always successful. This may result in a change being unsuccessful and a return to a previous state in order to re-start the change. Neither is desirable since it may be impact SLA guarantees such as service availability or service time that could result in the cloud provider paying out penalties. Since changes are not all applied at once it may be desirable to modify the change deployment schedule. For example, if an operator is not highly skilled or if the change's complexity is higher than expected then it may be preferable to apply the change during a time period when there are relatively few customers in order to minimize SLA violations. This paper shows how strategy trees can be incorporated into an autonomic change management system that could result in a switch of cloud provider policy sets to determine a new deployment schedule on the fly. Our experiments show that this approach can save time while minimizing SLA violations.;;2011;Otsuka, Hiroshi & Lutfiyya, Hanan;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2147671.2147693;International Federation for Information Processing;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;673;An optimal control policy to realize green cloud systems with SLA-awareness;The power management issue has always been a critical concern in cloud computing for supporting rapid growth of data centers. In this paper, our strategy is to implement working vacation (WV) to lower and eliminate unnecessary power consumed by idle servers. Two green systems are first proposed where one implements a single WV and the other implements multiple WVs in an operational cycle. The effect of various service rates and WV lengths on system delay and operating state probabilities is compared and studied. A cost function is developed by taking response time, system holding cost and power consumption cost into consideration. Control procedures in both green systems are mapped into Petri net-based models which contribute to designing a multiple decision process and describing system behaviors. The issue of determining the optimal service rate and WV length to obtain the cost optimality within response time guarantee is studied. The proposed Green control ( $$\mu $$ _ , $$\Theta )$$ ¿ ) policy combined with a heuristic algorithm allows cloud providers to solve constrained optimization problems.

The level of customer satisfaction is crucial in cloud computing and its success totally depends upon both customers and service providers can be confident that signed SLA’s are supporting their respective business activities to their best extent. However, there are no metrics can be referred to compare these providers, so it is difficult for cloud consumers to select the most reliable providers or resources. A main challenge for a service provider is to manage (Service Level Agreements) SLAs for its service consumers, i.e. automatically determine the appropriate resources required from the lower layer in order to respect the QoS requirements of his consumers. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are negotiated agreements of common understanding, between customers and service providers, which define the services provided along with their expected levels of performance. They help manage the strategic relationship between companies and Outsourcing service providers, hence the importance of SLA management has increased with the growth of Outsourcing in recent years. In this paper, we motivate the need for a SLA in cloud computing and a comparative study of different cloud providers SLA’s.

However, IPsec has not been designed with elasticity in mind, which makes clusters of IPsec security gateways hard to manage for providing high Service Level Agreement (SLA). Thus, these SG clusters need management techniques to maintain their Quality of Service. For example, ISPs use VPNs to secure millions of communications when offloading End-Users from Radio Access Networks towards alternative access networks such as WLANs. Additionally, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) providers also handle thousands of VPN connections when remote EUs access private clouds services. This paper describes how to provide Traffic Management (TM) and High Availability (HA) for VPN infrastructures by sharing or transferring an IPsec session. TM and HA have been implemented and evaluated over a 2-nodes cluster. We measured their impact on a real time audio streaming simulating a phone conversation.

A SLA is a part of a service contract between the consumer and provider that formally defines the level of service. In cloud computing, SLAs are necessary to control the use of computing resources. Therefore, a main issue for cloud computing is to build a new layer to support a negotiation phase between service providers and consumers to establish SLAs between them. In this paper, we propose a software agent based automated service negotiation framework for on-demand cloud service provision. In this framework, autonomous agents act on half of service providers and consumers to participate in negotiations in automated and efficient way.

METHODS: After scanned on 64 rows helical CT, the cortex part of the right 7th rib was selected as the prototype for design and manufacture of the rib prosthesis and image data were stored as DICOM format. Three-dimensional (3D) surface reconstruction was applied to produce 3D image of the 7th rib and results were outputted as STL format which were then modified by UG software for establishment of CAD model. RESULTS: The rib prosthesis with full geometric shape was obtained based on CT scanning and SLA technique. About 30,000 point cloud data were acquired after 3D laser scan of the ribs. When comparing the rib prosthesis with the rib prototype, the maximum positive deviation, maximum negative deviation, average deviation and standard deviation were 1.764 mm, -2.126 mm, 0.183/-0.253 mm and 0.346 mm, respectively. There were about 88.17\% of the point cloud data within the range of ±0.5 mm. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to design and fabricate rib prosthesis with full geometric shape by using CT scanning technology combined with CAD and SLA technologies. This method is fast, convenient and precise for manufacturing prosthesis.

In cloud computing various cloud consumers demand variety of services as per their dynamically changing needs. So it is the job of cloud computing to avail all the demanded services to the cloud consumers. But due to the availability of finite resources it is very difficult for cloud providers to provide all the demanded services. From the cloud providers' perspective cloud resources must be allocated in a fair manner. So, it's a vital issue to meet cloud consumers' QoS requirements and satisfaction.

The success of such a billing system depends on several factors: The billing transactions must have integrity and nonrepudiation capabilities; the billing transactions must be nonobstructive and have a minimal computation cost; and the service level agreement (SLA) monitoring should be provided in a trusted manner. Existing billing systems are limited in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and nonobstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. The cloud notary authority generates mutually verifiable binding information that can be used to resolve future disputes between a user and a cloud service provider in a computationally efficient way. Furthermore, to provide a forgery-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. The performance evaluation confirms that the overall latency of THEMIS billing transactions (avg. 4.89 ms) is much shorter than the latency of public key infrastructure (PKI)-based billing transactions (avg. 82.51 ms), though THEMIS guarantees identical security features as a PKI.

Such requirements are usually negotiated following a specific Quality of Service (QoS) model and are expressed using Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently available QoS models assume either that service provider and consumer have matching SLA templates and common understanding of the negotiated terms or provide public templates, which can be downloaded and utilized by the end users. On the one hand, matching SLA templates represent an unrealistic assumption in systems where service consumer and provider meet dynamically and on demand. On the other hand, handling of public templates seems to be a rather challenging issue, especially if the templates do not reflect users' needs. In this paper we present VieSLAF, a novel framework for the specification and management of SLA mappings.

Hosting centers host services of the clients on their behalf and guarantee quality of service as defined by service level agreements (SLAs.) To reduce energy consumption and to maximize profit it is critical to optimally allocate resources to meet client SLAs. Optimal allocation is a non-trivial task due to two factors: hosting centers have wide resource heterogeneity where energy consumption of a client task varies depending on the allocated resources. Second, due to lack of energy proportionality energy cost for a task varies based on server utilization. In this paper we introduce a generalized Network Flow based Resource Allocation framework, called NFRA, for energy minimization and profit maximization. NFRA provides a unified framework to model profit maximization under a wide range of SLAs. We will demonstrate the simplicity of this unified framework by deriving optimal resource allocations for three different SLAs.

In a federated cloud environment when resource requirements of user requests exceed resource limits of cloud provider, to fulfil the requests the cloud provider can out-source to other cloud providers' resources. Under these circumstances it is desirable to minimize the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. This can be achieved through load balancing.

Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the cloud computing system especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. Moreover, a data center typically hosts and manages a suite of application environments and a fixed number of servers that are allocated to these application environments in a way that maximizes a certain utility function. In this paper, we consider the problem of SLA-based joint optimization of application environment assignment, request dispatching from the clients to the servers, as well as resource allocation in a data center comprised of heterogeneous servers. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is the total price gained from serving the clients subtracted by the operation cost of the data center. The total price depends on the average service request response time for each client as defined in their utility functions, while the operating cost is related to the total energy consumption. We propose a near-optimal solution of the joint optimization problem based on the Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem, as well as convex optimization techniques, in a way that is similar to the constructive partitioning algorithm in VLSI computer-aided design (CAD). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed nearoptimal joint application environment assignment and resource allocation algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms by up to 65.7\%.;;2013;Pedram, Massoud;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2495254.2495605 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6520046;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;698;Energy-efficient datacenters;Pervasive use of cloud computing and the resulting rise in the number of datacenters and hosting centers (which provide platform or software services to clients who do not have the means to set up and operate their own compute facilities) have brought forth many concerns including the electrical energy cost, peak power dissipation, cooling, carbon emission, etc. With power consumption becoming an increasingly important issue for the operation and maintenance of the hosting centers, corporate and business owners are becoming increasingly concerned. Furthermore, provisioning resources in a cost-optimal manner so as to meet different performance criteria such as throughput or response time has become a critical challenge. The goal of this paper is to provide an introduction to resource provisioning and power/thermal management problems in datacenters and to review strategies that maximize the datacenter energy efficiency subject to peak/total power consumption and thermal constraints while at the same time meeting stipulated service level agreements in terms of task throughput and/or response time.;;2012;Pedram, Massoud;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.408.2398;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;699;The standardisation of cloud computing: Trends in the state-of-the-art and management issues for the next generation of cloud;Roll-out of future cloud systems will be influenced by regulations from the standardisation bodies, if made available across the community. Trends in cloud deployment, operation and management to date have not been guided by any regulatory standards, and resources have been deployed in an ad hoc manner as demanded according to the business objectives of service providers. This is the least costly and most quickly revenue-returning business model. It is not however, the most cost-effective approach on a long-term basis: As a consequence of this roll-out model to date, the interoperability of resources deployed across clouds managed by different operators is restricted through inability to allocate workload to them in a regulated and controllable manner. The absence of standardised approaches to cloud management is therefore beginning to be accommodated such that the cost and performance advantages of interoperable operation may be exploited. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in standards across the field and trends in their development. We present a model which defines the drivers for cloud interoperability and constraints which restrict the extent to which this may realistically occur in future scalable solutions.

A key motivating factor for this fast-paced adoption of cloud is the expectation of cost savings. Estimating what these cost savings might be requires comparing the known cost of running an application in-house with a predicted cost of its cloud deployment. A major problem with this approach is the lack of suitable techniques for predicting the cost of the virtual machines (VMs) that a cloud-deployed application requires in order to achieve a given service-level agreement. We introduce a technique that addresses this problem by using established results from queueing network theory to predict the minimum VM cost of cloud deployments starting from existing application logs.

In the current cloud computing scenario, the need for establishing an SLA is highly essential, since it expresses the commitment of provider to create an affordable balance between hosting costs and high levels of service availability during the service offerings. It is also highly necessary to monitor dynamically whether the QoS mentioned in the SLA, is met by the service provider. Moreover, a reliable trust model is required to give a quantitative measure of the trust to the requester before choosing a service provider. In this paper, we portray a dynamic trust establishment framework, wherein the Third-party SLA monitor provides an on-demand QoS assessment module, on a real time basis. Based on the computed trust value, the service provider is chosen. Then, the concept of Adaptive window-based state monitoring is introduced, negating the drawbacks associated with the existing techniques, by reducing the amount of data sent over the network.

This lack of security support has been a major hurdle for the adoption of cloud services, especially for enterprises and cautious consumers. To fix this issue, we present CloudProof, a secure storage system specifically designed for the cloud. In CloudProof, customers can not only detect violations of integrity, write-serializability, and freshness, they can also prove the occurrence of these violations to a third party. This proof-based system is critical to enabling security guarantees in SLAs, wherein clients pay for a desired level of security and are assured they will receive a certain compensation in the event of cloud misbehavior. Furthermore, since CloudProof aims to scale to the size of large enterprises, we delegate as much work as possible to the cloud and use cryptographic tools to allow customers to detect and prove cloud misbehavior. Our evaluation of CloudProof indicates that its security mechanisms have a reasonable cost: they incur a latency overhead of only _15 % on reads and writes, and reduce throughput by around 10%.

If more system capacity is required, servers in a low-power state are transitioned back to an active state. In this paper, we extend our prior research by presenting a new approach to determining the frequency of calculating the prediction of the expected capacity.

These new algorithms allow us to predict future load within required Service Level Agreements while minimizing the number of times the prediction calculations must be performed.

Existing research has demonstrated several algorithms that can be used to determine the optimal number of resources required to service these requests. However, a key issue not addressed in these algorithms is determining the frequency of recalculating the number of required resources. Changing the required resources at a rate slower than the optimal update frequency results in lower energy efficiency due to the over allocation of resources. Changing the resources at a rate higher than the optimal frequency results in insufficient time for systems to change state, which results in SLA violations. In this paper, a stochastic optimization model is presented that determines the optimal update frequency for changing the states of the nodes of the cloud as well as determining the proper frequency for recalculating the maximum expected load, which improves the determination of the optimum number of resources required, therefore maximizes energy efficiency and minimizes SLA violations.;;2013;"Prevost, John J.; Nagothu, Kranthimanoj; Kelley, Brian & Jamshidi, Mo";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6575260;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;715;DBA-VM: Dynamic bandwidth allocator for virtual machines;Cloud computing is an emergent paradigm that allows customers to rent infrastructure, platforms and software as a service.

Therefore, to promote the trusted service selection, we should first evaluate the trust of each cloud service, based on its historical QoS records from past invocations. However, different from the traditional web service whose historical QoS record is a fixed value (e.g., a historical latency record of a web service is 2s), the historical QoS record of a cloud service is usually not fixed, but fluctuant during the long-running period of a single service invocation. For example, an virtual organization O rents cloud service WeatherInquiry between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm so that the employees of O can access WeatherInquiry. In this scenario, the latency of WeatherInquiry is fluctuant from the perspective of organization O, during the served 12 hours. In this situation, it is a challenge to evaluate the trust of service WeatherInquiry, based on WeatherInquiry's multiple historical QoS records that fluctuate continuously. In view of this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of flexible SLA, to better accommodate the fluctuant QoS of cloud service, and further put forward a trust evaluation method based on fluctuant QoS and flexible SLA, i.e., FL-FL (FLuctuant QoS-FLexible SLA-based trust evaluation method, FL-FL).

Single cloud service providers could not offer quality services to user's requirements when workload becomes very high. Federated cloud mechanism helps to resolve the difficulties present in the single cloud service model. Better Resource Provisioning to user's requirements is one of the difficult tasks in federated cloud mechanism. Cloud Brokers takes the responsibility of resource provisioning in federated cloud model. Cloud brokers make use of the concept of cloud ranking to choose the best cloud service provider among the number of cloud service providers who satisfies the user requirements. Based upon the cloud ranking cloud broker assigns the user task to the selected cloud service provider. Up to now there is no standard method for cloud ranking.

A cloud is an aggregation of resources or services that are provided as service through network. In earlier version of cloud computing (grid computing) it was enough to find the subset of resources for the applications whereas cloud computing goes one step higher allocating resources to Virtual Machines (VM's) as well as scheduling tasks on the VM's. So resource scheduling is indispensable in cloud computing for load balancing and maximizing the utilization while minimizing the execution time and energy. Few approaches relating to energy salvation have certain disadvantages such as, time complexity and slow Convergence. Hence Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) is developed by bringing together the echo-localization and hibernation properties for scheduling resources as well as conserving energy. Promotion of energy salvation in cloud environment is achieved in a well delineated manner. By using the performance metrics such as total energy consumed by physical resources, SLA violation (CPU performance) and VM migration, we have manipulated our approach through real time implementation by setting up a private cloud employing VMware.;;2014;"Raju, R; Amudhavel, J; Kannan, Nevedha & Monisha, M";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6922463;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;727;A Proposal of a Simulation-Based Approach for Service Level Agreement in Cloud;Clouds offer resources as services, which are charged on the basis of their actual usage. An approach that is currently spreading, to face possible problems linked to a low quality of service offered, is the adoption of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper we propose the adoption of a simulation-based approach for supporting a framework in charge of SLA management in cloud applications. The idea stems from the consideration that to face the inevitable impact on QoS of the cloud elasticity, it is necessary to evaluate in a predictive way the performance properties of the many different configurations among which the automatic cloud management can choose to allocate resources to customers. This paper proposes the architecture of the framework for SLA management in clouds, identifying the requirements implied by the simulation to be performed and suggesting the adoption of a simulation engine that fits with the proposed requirements.;;2013;"Rak, M.; Cuomo, A. & Villano, U.";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2497619.2497954 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6550564;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;728;A SLA-based interface for security management in cloud and GRID integrations;Cloud Computing is a new computing paradigm. Among the incredible number of challenges in this field two of them are considered of great relevance: SLA management and Security management. The level of trust in such context is very hard to define and is strictly related to the problem of management of SLA in cloud applications and providers. In this paper we will try to show how it is possible, using a cloud-oriented API derived from the mOSAIC project, to build up an SLA-oriented cloud application which enables the management of security features related to user authentication and authorization to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud Provider. As Cloud Provider we will adopt the perf-Cloud solution, which uses GRID-based solutions for security management and service delivery.

While this ease of migration is appealing, several security issues arise: can the validity of corporate legal compliance regulations still be ensured for remote data storage? How is it possible to assess the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) ability to meet corporate security requirements? Can one monitor and enforce the agreed cloud security levels? Unfortunately, no comprehensive solutions exist for these issues. In this context, we introduce a new approach, named SPECS. It aims to offer mechanisms to specify cloud security requirements and to assess the security features offered by CSPs, and to integrate the desired security services (e.g., credential and access management) into cloud services with a Security-as-a-Service approach. Furthermore, SPECS intends to provide systematic approaches to negotiate, to monitor and to enforce the security parameters specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA), to develop and to deploy security services that are cloud SLA-aware and are implemented as an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

Once the problem of enabling developers to manage cloud resources in a clear and flexible way is solved, a new problem emerges: the monitoring of the quality of the acquired resources and of the services offered to final users. As the first step, the mOSAIC API and framework aim at offering a solution for the development of interoperable, portable and cloud-provider independent cloud applications.

These assets can be dynamically reconfigured to adjust to a variable scale, allowing also for optimum resource utilization. This pool of resources is typically exploited by a pay-per-use model in which guarantees are offered by the infrastructure provider by means of customized service level agreement (SLA). Cloud computing was originally designed for dealing with problems involving large amounts of data and/or compute-intensive applications. The vulnerabilities inherent in the Cloud systems should be addressed so they can be eliminated before exploited by malicious software or hackers.

As a result, such platforms are better equipped to execute workloads with diverse I/O requirements, ranging from throughput-intensive applications, such as `big data' analytics, to latency-sensitive applications, such as online applications with strict response-time guarantees. Improvements are also seen for the virtualization infrastructures used in data center settings, where high virtualized I/O performance supported by high-end fabrics enables more applications to be configured and deployed in multiple VMs - VM ensembles (VMEs) - distributed and communicating across multiple datacenter nodes. A challenge for I/O-intensive VM ensembles is the efficient management of the virtualized I/O and compute resources they share with other consolidated applications, particularly in lieu of VME-level SLA requirements like those pertaining to low or predictable end-to-end latencies for applications comprised of sets of interacting services. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a management solution able to consider such SLA requirements, by supporting diverse SLA-aware policies, such as those maintaining bounded SLA guarantees for all VMEs, or those that minimize the impact of misbehaving VMEs. The management solution, termed Distributed Resource Exchange (DRX), borrows techniques from principles of microeconomics, and uses online resource pricing methods to provide mechanisms for such distributed and coordinated resource management. DRX and its mechanisms allow policies to be deployed on such a cluster in order to provide SLA guarantees to some applications by charging all the interfering VMEs `equally' or based on the `hurt', i.e. amount of I/O performed by the VMEs. While these mechanisms are gen- ral, our implementation is specifically for SR-IOV-based fabrics like InfiniBand and the KVM hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation consists of workloads representative of data-analytics, transactional and parallel benchmarks. The results demonstrate the feasibility of DRX and its utility to maintain SLA for transactional applications. We also show that the impact to the interfering workloads is also within acceptable bounds for certain policies.;;2013;"Ranadive, Adit; Gavrilovska, Ada & Schwan, Karsten";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6702653;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;733;Capacity-Aware Utility Function for SLA Negotiation of Cloud Services;Dynamic customers' requirements and providers' resources availability in the Cloud market make it inadequate static approaches to guarantee QoS levels and to define pricing. In this context, automatic negotiation guided by dynamic information and market conditions is a viable way to achieve high satisfaction levels for both parties. We propose to exploit capacity planning to support bilateral negotiation processes with the aim of optimizing the utility for service providers, by avoiding contracts that could incur in SLAs violations, keeping, at the same time, competitive prices. The proposed technique exploits a non-additive utility function defined in the region of acceptable SLA proposals, taking into account QoS, resources availability, costs and penalties.

Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), built at the edge of the Internet, are able to reduce the workload of network backbones but their scalability and network reach is often limited, especially in case of QoS-bound delivery services. By using the emerging CDN internetworking, a CDN can dynamically exploit resources of other cooperating CDNs to face peak loads and temporary malfunctions without violating QoS levels negotiated with content providers. This paper proposes an architectural schema and an algorithm to minimize transfer time of large files taking into account the SLA constraints agreed between the CDN in charge of content delivery and the content provider, while respecting the maximum budget that the CDN can pay to peer CDNs to ensure its revenue.

This technology allows rather more efficient computing by consolidative data storage, processing and bandwidth. The specialty of this technology is that any variety of cloud services can be simultaneously accessed by any variety of users. So it is necessary that every user should get sufficient resources in a well-organized manner. The resource allocation in cloud computing is nothing but integrating the cloud provider activities in order to utilize and allocate scarce resources. The service level agreement satisfaction is incredibly necessary concerning the user as well as the service provider. Minimum SLA violation brings most client satisfaction.

However, current infrastructures only support resource-level metrics-e.g. CPU share and memory allocation-and there is not a well-known mechanism to translate from service-level metrics to resource-level metrics. Moreover, the lack of precise information regarding the requirements of the services leads to an inefficient resource allocation-usually, providers allocate whole resources to prevent SLA violations. According to this, we propose a novel mechanism to overcome this translation problem using an online prediction system which includes a fast analytical predictor and an adaptive machine learning based predictor. We also show how a deadline scheduler could use these predictions to help providers to make the most of their resources.

The monitoring domain is a mature and competitive one with many offerings ranging from traditional closed proprietary products to open-source collaborative projects. Whilst the offerings have continued to increase in their core monitoring capabilities and sophistication, one area which has received less attention is the programmatic control of monitoring configuration; most monitoring solutions provide little to support the solution designer's goal of loose coupling with high cohesion between the service management layer and the monitoring layer. There is still less support for such a Service Management Layer to specify it's monitoring requirements in terms of the SLA the services it manages are being offered against. The reality is that monitoring is often configured manually on an ad-hoc basis, resulting in an evolved monitoring configuration which is poorly structured, inefficient and unmanageable. This paper presents the authors' work in progressing a design which allows a service management layer to consume monitoring as a service programmatically as per the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm. This makes monitoring auditable, flexible and efficient. Further, the design shifts the primitives used to define the monitoring requirements away from machines, ports and intra-machine services (e.g. HTTP) to the SLA and the distributed services which a whole set of diverse machines co-operate in order to support (e.g. an instance of a SaaS CRM enterprise app). The aim is to allow the operator to promote the SLA such that their systems can optimise customer satisfaction while minimising their cost base. Whilst this approach offers benefits for the management of all data centres, those which are retailing a catalogue of quality-assured, cloud-based SaaS offerings may see the greatest g- - ains as the design elegantly allows for instances of the offerings to be deployed quickly and scaled automatically, including all the required SLA-driven monitoring configuration.";;2011;"Roxburgh, David; Spaven, Daniel & Gallen, Craig";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5990500;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;754;Reducing service failures by failure and workload aware load balancing in SaaS clouds;SLA violations are typically viewed as service failures. If service fails once, it will fail again unless remedial action is taken. In a virtualized environment, a common remedial action is to restart or reboot a virtual machine (VM). In this paper we present, a VM live-migration policy that is aware of SLA threshold violations of workload response time, physical machine (PM) and VM utilization as well as availability violations at the PM and VM. In the migration policy we take into account PM failures and VM (software) failures as well as workload features such as burstiness (coefficient of variation or CoV >1) which calls for caution during the selection of target PM when migrating these workloads. The proposed policy also considers migration of a VM when the utilization of the physical machine hosting the VM approaches its utilization threshold. We propose an algorithm that detects proactive triggers for remedial action, selects a VM (for migration) and also suggests a possible target PM. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach by plotting the decrease in the number of SLA violations in a system using our approach over existing approaches that do not trigger migration in response to non-availability related SLA violations, via discrete event simulation of a relevant case study.;;2013;"Roy, Arpan; Ganesan, Rajeshwari; Dash, Dinesh & Sarkar, Santonu";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6615511;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;755;Keep it moving: Proactive workload management for reducing SLA violations in large scale SaaS clouds;Software failures, workload-related failures and job overload conditions bring about SLA violations in software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. Existing work does not address mitigation of SLA violations completely as (i) none of them address mitigation of SLA violations in business specific scenarios (SaaS, in our case), (ii) while some do not address software and workload-related failures, other approaches do not address the problem of target PM selection for workload migration comprehensively (leaving out vital considerations like workload compatibility checks between migrating VM and VMs at the target PM) and (iii) a clear mathematical mapping between workload, resource demand and SLA is lacking. In this paper, we present the Keep It Moving (KIM) software framework for the cloud controller that helps minimize service failures due to SLA violation of availability, utilization and response time in SaaS cloud data centers. Though we consider migration to be the primary mitigation technique, we also try to mitigate SLA violations without migration. We achieve this by performing a capacity check on the host physical machine (PM) before the migration to identify if enough capacity is available on the current PM to address the upcoming SLA violations by restart/reboot or VM resizing. In certain cases such as workload-related failures due to corrupt files, we prefer workload rerouting to a replica VM over migration. We formulate the selection of a target PM as a multi-objective optimization problem. We validate our proposed approach by using a trace-based discrete event simulation of a virtualized data center where failure and workload characteristics are simulated from data extracted from a real SaaS business server logs. We found that a 60\% reduction in SLA violation is possible using our approach as well as reducing VM downtime by approximately 10\%.;;2013;"Roy, Arpan; Ganesan, Rajeshwari & Sarkar, Santonu";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6698895;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;756;Efficient Parallel Data Management Providing Load Balancing Service in Cloud Environment;Cloud is one of the rapidly developing technologies as it allows convergence of many new areas like scalability, rapid elasticity and broad network access in cloud services. This paper focuses on resource allocation for the parallel data processing, which also occupies a major issue in cloud computing. The current paper aims to study the two major cloud problems i.e. QOS constrained resource allocation and parallel data management problems. The customer demands the cloud provider to host their application with desired SLA such as throughput, response time among others. We have proposed a methodology which is expected to achieve the specified SLA requirements in parallel data management and forecast/identifies the load to be processed by the cloud. This may use the divide and conquer strategy to predict the load on VM’s (in dividing phase) and which will be allocated to that requested customer.

Therefore, appropriate mechanisms for an automated negotiation of Quality of Service parameters are required that do not only consider the individual business objectives and strategies of the negotiation partners involved, but do also account for the dependencies between the different services and service tiers in cloud computing. This enables enterprises to increase the quality and flexibility of their business processes and lays the foundation for market-based complex service provisioning.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) identify the cost that a user must pay to achieve the required QoS, and a penalty that must be paid to the user in case the QoS cannot be met. Assuming the maximisation of the revenue as the provider's objective, then it must decide which streams to accept for storage and analysis; and how many (computational / storage) resources to allocate to each stream in order to improve overall revenue. We propose an infrastructure for supporting QoS for concurrent data streams to be composed of self-regulating nodes. Each node features an envelope process to accept user streams; and a resource manager to enable resource allocation, admission control and selective SLA violations, while maximizing revenue.";;2012;;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2437790.2437797;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;759;Towards a federated cloud ecosystem: enabling managed cloud service consumption;While cloud computing has seen widespread usage, there exist domains where the diminishing of management capabilities associated with cloud computing prevent adoption. One such domain is the health sector, which is the focus of the TRESOR project. Enabling cloud computing usage under strict compliance constraints such as enterprise policies and legal regulations is the goal of TRESOR. The main approach consists of a distributed cloud proxy, acting as a trusted mediator between cloud consumers and service providers. In this paper we analyze issues which arise within the TRESOR context and show how an architecture for a proposed ecosystem bypasses these issues. The practicability of our solution is shown by a proof of concept proxy implementation.

The terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) to be provided as well as the economic conditions are established in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). There are situations in which providers must differentiate the SLAs in function of the type of Client that is willing to access the resources or the agreed QoS e.g. when the hardware resources are shared between users of the company that own the resources and external users.This paper proposes to consider the information of potential users when the SLA is under negotiation to allow providers to prioritize users (e.g. internal users over external users, or preferential users over common users). Two policies for negotiation are introduced: price discrimination and client-aware overselling of resources. The validity of the policies is demonstrated through exhaustive experiments.";;2011;;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2238296.2238306;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;761;A protocol development framework for SLA negotiations in cloud and service computing;"As businesses transit towards cloud and service oriented economy, agents are employed to efficiently negotiate service level agreements (SLAs) on services procured automatically to match changes in demand.

To this end, we present a domain-independent framework based on a protocol development lifecycle, comprising four distinct phases namely modeling, verification, rule-based implementation and generic execution.We illustrate all phases by introducing the Simple Bilateral Negotiation Protocol (SBNP) - a multi-tier, multi-round and customizable negotiation protocol. We exemplify its adoption among chains of service providers that serve SaaS, PaaS and IaaS offerings. We show that SBNP is well-formed, deterministic and deadlock-free. We evaluate state space scalability for SBNP and verify its correctness using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).

In such dynamic environment, managing distributed heterogeneous resources is challenging. A Cloud workload is typically decomposed into advance reservation and on-demand requests. Under advance reservation, end-users have the opportunity to reserve in advance the estimated required resources for the completion of their jobs without any further commitment. Thus, Cloud service providers can make a better use of their infrastructure while provisioning the proposed services under determined policies and/or time constraints. However, estimating end-users resource requirements is often error prone. Such uncertainties associated with job execution time and/or SLA satisfaction significantly increase the complexity of the resource management. Therefore, an appropriate resource management by Cloud service providers is crucial for harnessing the power of the underlying distributed infrastructure and achieving high system performance. In this paper, we investigate the resource provisioning problem for advance reservation under a Pay-as-you-Book pricing model. Our model offers to handle the extra-time required by some jobs at a higher price on a best-effort basis. However, satisfying these extra-times may lead to several advance reservations competing for the same resources. We propose a novel economic agent responsible for managing such conflicts. This agent aims at maximizing Cloud service provider revenues while complying with SLA terms. We show that our agent achieves higher return on investment compared to intuitive approaches that systematically prioritize reserved jobs or currently running jobs.;;2012;;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2437790.2437794;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;763;Designing Networks and Services for the Cloud: Delivering business-grade cloud applications and services;;;2013;"Saboowala, Huseni; Abid, Muhammad & Modali, Sudhir";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2500970;WebEx Communications;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;764;Service-Oriented and Cloud Computing;;;2012;Sagbo, Kouessi Arafat Romaric & Houngue, P\'{e}lagie;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2413832.2413847;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;765;SLA-Based and Consumer-centric Dynamic Provisioning for Cloud Databases;One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware purchasing and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. Cloud-hosted database systems powering these applications form a critical component in the software stack of these applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreement (SLA) for cloud services are not designed for flexibly handling even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. The concerns of consumers for cloud services regarding the SLA management of their hosted applications within the cloud environments will gain increasing importance as cloud computing becomes more pervasive. This paper introduces the notion, challenges and the importance of SLA-based provisioning and cost management for cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework that acts as a middleware which resides between the consumer applications and the cloud-hosted databases. The aim of the framework is to facilitate adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources.

The mean service time is a critical metric to estimate, and contributes to the SLA end-to-end response time experienced by application users. The end-to-end response time is an aggregated delay of the service time in addition to delays incurred at the network nodes and links. Our analytical model focuses on estimating the mean service time; however, the model is sufficiently general and can be extremely useful in studying cloud performance.

Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. In both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9\% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. Observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species.

We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47cm2g_1). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P<0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P<0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly.

Specifically, our main contributions are two-fold: First, the feasible regions of various routing algorithms for the system's dispatcher are investigated in depth. Second, a simple heuristic algorithm is designed, to move the average delay point along the feasible direction until achieving the delay constraints. Average delay is dependent on multiple factors such as job size, inter-arrival time, flow rate, and the dispatching rules of the system.

The main difference between the two models is the energy and time required to put the server in operational mode from a sleep mode or from an off state. Therefore, the decision is a tradeoff between the energy savings and the required performance according to the SLA between the client and the cloud provider.

This paper provides a good solution for enterprises to improve the utilization benefit of information resources in Cloud computing arena using simulation and modeling approach for the private cloud provisioning, cloud business process workflow design, ticketing system, change management etc. By the application of system dynamics, this paper conducts a qualitative and quantitative research on mechanism of information resources allocation in cloud computing, managed \& shared services, Infrastructure management business process modeling (BPM) and simulation. The paper aims to create a dynamic cloud business process modeling mechanisms which helps managers understand better the dynamic interrelationships in organization design and, in particular, the interrelationships between an organization's profitability (both short-term and long-term) and investment in cloud computing and overall infrastructure.

But running these systems on bare metal servers results in low resource utilization, because database servers often have to be sized for peak loads, much higher than the average load. Instead, we propose to deploy them within light-weight containers that allow to control resource usage and to make use of spare resources by temporarily running other applications on the database server using virtual machines (VMs). The servers on which these VMs would normally run can be suspended, to save energy costs. But current database systems do not handle dynamic changes to resource allocation well and accurate estimates on resource demand are required to maintain SLAs. We focus on emerging main-memory database systems that support the mixed workloads of today's business intelligence applications and propose an cooperative approach in which the DBMS communicates its resource demand, gets informed about currently assigned resources and adapts its resource usage accordingly. We analyze the performance impact on the database system when spare resources are used by VMs and monitor SLA compliance.;;2012;"Seibold, Michael; Wolke, Andreas; Albutiu, Martina; Bichler, Martin; Kemper, Alfons & Setzer, Thomas";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253520 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353823;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;785;Energy Efficient VM Live Migration in Cloud Data Centers;;;;Sekhar, Jyothi & Jeba, Getzi;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.300.6376;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;786;A Survey on Energy Efficient Server Consolidation Through;;;;"Sekhar, Jyothi; Jeba, Getzi & Durga, S.";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.384.7343;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;787;Negotiation-Based Flexible SLA Establishment with SLA-driven Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing;As various consumers tend to use personalized Cloud services, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) emerge as a key aspect in Cloud and Utility computing. The objectives of this doctoral research are 1) to support a flexible establishment of SLAs that enhances the utility of SLAs for both providers and consumers, and 2) to manage Cloud resources to prevent SLA violations. Because consumers and providers may be independent bodies, some mechanisms are necessary to resolve different preferences when they establish a SLA. Thus, we designed a Cloud SLA negotiation mechanism for interactive and flexible SLA establishment. The novelty of this SLA negotiation mechanism is that it can support advanced multi-issue negotiation that includes time slot and price negotiations. In addition, to prevent SLA violations, we provided a SLA-driven resource allocation scheme that selects a proper data center among globally distributed centers operated by a provider. Empirical results showed that the proposed SLA negotiation mechanism supports faster agreements and achieves higher utilities. Also, the proposed SLA-driven resource allocation scheme performs better in terms of SLA violations and the provider's profits.;;2013;Seokho Son & Sung Chan Jun;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546077;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;788;Towards Assurance of Availability in Virtualized Cloud System;Cloud computing naturally shares physical resources, which is provided by virtualization technology.

However, its ad hoc management of quality-of-service and SLA poses significant challenges to the performance, dependability and costs of online cloud services. The paper precisely addresses this issue and makes a threefold contribution. First, it introduces a new cloud model, the SLAaaS (SLA aware Service) model. SLAaaS enables a systematic integration of QoS levels and SLA into the cloud. It is orthogonal to other cloud models such as SaaS or PaaS, and may apply to any of them. Second, the paper introduces CSLA, a novel language to describe QoS-oriented SLA associated with cloud services. Third, the paper presents a control theoretic approach to provide performance, dependability and cost guarantees for online cloud services, with time-varying workloads. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and extensive experiments with online services hosted in clouds such as Amazon EC2. The case studies illustrate SLA guarantees for various services such as a MapReduce service, a cluster-based multi-tier e-commerce service, and a low-level locking service.;;2013;"Serrano, D.; Bouchenak, S.; Kouki, Y.; Ledoux, T.; Lejeune, J.; Sopena, J.; Arantes, L. & Sens, P.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546058;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;791;METE: meeting end-to-end QoS in multicores through system-wide resource management;;;2011;"Sharifi, Akbar; Srikantaiah, Shekhar; Mishra, Asit K.; Kandemir, Mahmut & Das, Chita R.";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2007116.2007119;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;792;Energy efficient architectural framework for virtual machine management in IaaS clouds;Cloud computing is a novel computing model, involving resource outsourcing with infinite and flexible resource scalability and “plug and play” provisioning. The recent materialization of this new computing model has radically changed everyone's perception of infrastructure paradigm, development models and delivery of software. Earlier people were reluctant to go for Clouds due to doubt on performance so since its inception main emphasis has been given on performance so that SLA is not violated. So resources were over provisioned to meet peak demands which resulted in underutilization of servers in off peak hours. This resulted in high power consumption, high carbon footprints and high cooling cost. We are proposing an energy efficient framework for Virtual Machine management which will result in minimum no. of servers used which will further result in low power consumption, low carbon footprints and which will make Cloud computing economical for both consumers and providers. Our model differs from others since we have restricted CPU utilization to a threshold limit as it has been experimentally proved that power consumption increases drastically when CPU utilization increases beyond 70\%. Moreover it also gives room for scaling up resources during peak hours.;;2013;Sharma, Viney & Srivastava, Gur Mauj Saran;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6612222;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;793;Doing Better Business: Trading a Little Execution Time for High Energy Saving under SLA Constraints;Large data centers are usually built to support the enormous computation and storage capability of Cloud Computing which has attracted people's attention nowadays. However, such large scale data centers generally consume an enormous amount of energy, which not only increases the running cost but also simultaneously enhances their greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing this issue, Virtualization technology is introduced, through which multiple Virtual Machines(VMs) can be centralized to fewer servers while allowing the idle servers to be dynamically powered off in order to save the energy consumption. In the paper, we investigate the impact of Virtualization technology on the energy and performance in data center environment taking into consideration various factors such as server failures and the overhead introduced by the VM contention. Noticing that there exits a tradeoff between energy consumption and execution time, we propose a stochastic model of data centers using Queueing theory to optimize performance and energy consumption. From the data center operators' prospective, they are willing to do better business by saving the energy consumption while abiding by the SLAs. Therefore, we try to find an optimal Energy-Performance tradeoff policy for the data center operators to operate data centers. The simulation results show that our model can significantly reduce the energy consumption by up to 35.4 while sacrificing a little execution time.;;2013;"Shen, Dian; Dong, Fang; Luo, Junzhou; Wang, Wei; Fei, Xiang; Jin, Guoqing & Li, Weidong";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686244 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2549765.2549795;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;794;A workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism in cloud computing;With the emerging of cloud computing, more and more enterprise organizations begin to migrate their applications to IaaS, which is a more flexible and cheaper alternative to traditional infrastructures. IaaS providers usually offer customers with resources in the form of VM and charge them in a time-based billing model. Meanwhile customers are allowed to dynamically apply for VM resources. However, highly dynamic workload makes customers difficultly determine how much capacity to provision. Furthermore, it is also a great challenge for customers to determine how to choose a VM provisioning scheme to match workload at a low cost. In this paper, we propose a workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism to overcome these challenges, which contains an ARIMA workload predictor with dynamic error compensation (ARIMA-DEC) and a time-based billing aware multi-VM provisioning algorithm (TBAMP). The experimental results show that ARIMA-DEC predictor can obviously reduce SLA default rate and TBAMP algorithm can effectively save rental cost comparing to the existing algorithms.;;2013;"Shengming Li; Ying Wang; Xuesong Qiu; Deyuan Wang & Lijun Wang";;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;795;Towards Profitable Virtual Machine Placement in the Data Center;Motivated by the limit on the power usage effectiveness (PUE) of the data centers, the potential benefit of the consolidation, and the impetus of achieving maximum return on investment (ROI) on the cloud computing market, we investigate VM placement in the data center, formulate a multi-level generalized assignment problem (MGAP) for maximizing the profit under the service level agreement and the power budget constraint based on the model of a virtualized data center, and solve it with a first-fit heuristic.

One immediate benefit lies in the way that enterprise customers may have plenty of choices of available providers, when seeking cloud services to fulfill their criteria, such as price or Service Level Agreement (SLA). However, how to select appropriate cloud offerings in terms of business requirements and company policies becomes challenging and non-trivial, especially when a composition of multiple services are to be chosen for achieving business goals.

It is becoming increasingly complex for cloud users to make distinction (with respect to trustworthiness) among service providers offering similar kinds of services. There must be some mechanisms in the hands of users to determine trustworthiness of service providers so that they can select service providers with confidence and with some degree of assurance that service provider will not behave unpredictably or maliciously. Though various approaches exist to form trust between service providers and users, little work has been done in the area of forming trust based on compliance of QoS parameters which have been promised in SLA. In this paper an attempt has been made to design and simulate a mechanism to calculate trustworthiness of service providers based on their compliance to promised SLA parameters. The model has been simulated in MATLAB. The validation has been done using synthetic data set. Validation results show that approach is workable and can be used to evaluate trustworthiness of service providers in a cloud environment.;;2014;Sidhu, Jagpreet & Singh, Sarbjeet;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091401031X;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;800;GeoClouds Modcs: A perfomability evaluation tool for disaster tolerant IaaS clouds;Performance and availability are key aspects to evaluate the quality of cloud computing systems. The assessment of these systems should consider the effects of queuing and failure/recovery behavior of data center subsystems and disaster occurrences. Additionally, penalties may be applied if the defined quality level of SLA contracts is not satisfied. Thus, IaaS providers need to evaluate the performability level of its environment, considering, also, the possibility of disasters. A possible approach to protect cloud systems from natural disasters corresponds to the utilization of redundant data centers located far enough apart. However, the time to back up the VM data increases with the distance. To accomplish these issues, we propose a user-friendly tool, namely GeoClouds Modcs, for evaluating distributed cloud computing systems deployed into multiple data centers considering disaster occurrence. The proposed environment adopts a hybrid heterogeneous modeling approach, which includes Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) and Cloud System High-Level models to perform the system evaluation. For specialized users, the tool also provides specific features that enable edit and evaluate the result SPN and RBD models on external evaluation tools (i.e., Mercury and TimeNET).

This task becomes still harder when content popularity varies over the time and the SLA definitions have to include both transfer rate and latency metrics. Current worldwide content delivery approaches and datacenter infrastructures rely on cumbersome replication schemes that are agnostic to edge-network resources, and damage content provision. In this work we present AREN, an novel replication scheme for cloud storage on edge networks. AREN relies on a collaborative cache strategy and bandwidth reservation to adapt the replication degree according to strict SLA contracts and content popularity growth. We have evaluated the performances of replication schemes on edge networks using Caju, a content distribution system for edge networks. Compared to a non-collaborative caching, evaluations show that AREN prevents nearly 99.8\% of all SLA violations when the storage system is heavily loaded. We also show that AREN provides a sevenfold decrease in the amount of storage usage for replicas, and it increases by roughly 20\% the aggregate bandwidth, hence accelerating content delivery.;;2012;"Silvestre, Guthemberg; Monnet, Sebastien; Krishnaswamy, Ruby & Sens, Pierre";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6413697 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2473505.2474592;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;803;Performing accurate simulations for deadline-aware applications;One of the most appealing aspects of cloud computing is its potential capacity of offering customized services for clients through Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts. Emerging cloud providers are intended to provide services whose performance targets are defined by precise data transfer deadlines. Yet, enforcing strict transfer rates for cloud-like applications is not simple. This has caught system designers and analysts' interest, and drawn their attention to study and evaluate the performance of deadline-aware applications. In order to address the increasing demand for performance evaluation tools for deadline-aware simulations, we present a bandwidth scheduling component for the PeerSim simulator. Our component provides a lightweight and accurate fair-sharing of bandwidth and rate control enforcement. We assume a simple approach that does not reproduce in-depth transport protocol behaviour. Instead, our design focuses in reducing the inherent impact on the overall simulation scalability as bandwidth scheduling accuracy is improved. We have studied the scalability and bandwidth scheduling accuracy of four scheduling approaches, namely the simplest, lock-based, packet or slot-based, and connection-oriented bandwidth scheduler. We have verified that a connection-oriented approach allows us to (i) improve considerably the accuracy of fair bandwidth sharing, and (ii) implement a rate control mechanism properly.

Through a 4-stage resource discovery process (selection, evaluation, filtering, and recommendation), a set of broker agents match consumers' requests to advertisements from providers. Following the matching of requests to resources, consumer and provider agents negotiate for mutually acceptable resource time slots.

However, this credit scheme is too inflexible because consumers lose a non measurable quantity of performance and are only compensated later (i.e. in the next charging cycle). We propose to schedule cloud isolation and execution units, i.e. virtual machines (VMs), driven by the partial utility of applying a certain amount of resources (CPU, memory or bandwidth) to a given VM. This partial utility metric, specified by the customer, allows the provider to transfer resources between VMs. This is particularly relevant for private clouds where resources are not so abundant. We have defined a cost model that incorporates the partial utility the client gives to a certain level of depreciation when VMs are allocated in an over commit environment. CloudSim, a state of the art cloud simulator, was extended to support our partial utility-driven scheduling model. Using simulation scenarios with synthetic and real workloads, we show that our proposed scheduling strategy brings benefits to providers (i.e. revenue, resource utilization) and clients (i.e. workloads' execution time) by incorporating a SLA-based depreciation of computational power, allowing for more VMs to be allocated.;;2013;Simao, Jose & Veiga, Luis;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568486.2568496 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6753808;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;806;Autonomic mix-aware provisioning for non-stationary data center workloads;;;2010;"Singh, Rahul; Sharma, Upendra; Cecchet, Emmanuel & Shenoy, Prashant";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.182.9393 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1809049.1809053;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;807;An extensibility of THEMIS billing system for the cloud computing environment;With the advent and acceptance of cloud computing the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a convincing and capricious way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike.

Traditional billing systems are not enough in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and no obstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. Moreover, to provide a falsification-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. From the perspective of extensibility, THEMIS is moreover applicable to various target services as well to improve the accountability of each service by applying more monitoring techniques to S-Mon.

SLAs are negotiated and may have legal standing, which makes their maintenance expensive and time consuming. If an SLA is established that meets the requirements of the service consumer, changing the software without updating the configuration and/or the SLA may result in unmet requirements and reduced satisfaction.

A simulation-driven approach to updating a configuration in step with ongoing maintenance efforts is presented. The approach is illustrated using a case study, where we examine how a configuration is updated in two maintenance scenarios: one where the application is migrated to a cloud computing platform, and another where it is migrated to use a distributed computing platform.

The resource capacity of a data center is limited, so distributing the load to global data centers will be effective in providing stable services. Another issue in cloud computing is the need for providers to guarantee the service level agreements (SLAs) established with consumers. Whereas various load balancing algorithms have been developed, it is necessary to avoid SLA violations (e.g., service response time) when a cloud provider allocates the load to data centers geographically distributed across the world. Considering load balancing and guaranteed SLA, therefore, this paper proposes an SLA-based cloud computing framework to facilitate resource allocation that takes into account the workload and geographical location of distributed data centers. The contributions of this paper include: (1) the design of a cloud computing framework that includes an automated SLA negotiation mechanism and a workload- and location-aware resource allocation scheme (WLARA), and (2) the implementation of an agent-based cloud testbed of the proposed framework. Using the testbed, experiments were conducted to compare the proposed schemes with related approaches. Empirical results show that the proposed WLARA performs better than other related approaches (e.g., round robin, greedy, and manual allocation) in terms of SLA violations and the provider's profits.

Multi-tenancy database has been prevalent for hosting multiple tenants within a single DBMS while enabling effective resource sharing. Providing such performance goals is challenging for providers as they must balance the performance that they can deliver to tenants and the operating costs. In such database systems, a key functionality for service providers is database replication, which is useful for availability, performance, elasticity, and quality of service. This paper presents RepliC, an approach to database replication in the cloud with quality of service, elasticity, and support tomulti-tenancy. In order to evaluate RepliC, some experiments that measure the quality of service and elasticity are presented.

With the high costs of data storage devices as well as the rapid rate at which data is being generated it proves costly for enterprises or individual users to frequently update their hardware. Apart from reduction in storage costs data outsourcing to the cloud also helps in reducing the maintenance. Cloud storage moves the user's data to large data centers, which are remotely located, on which user does not have any control. However, this unique feature of the cloud poses many new security challenges which need to be clearly understood and resolved. One of the important concerns that need to be addressed is to assure the customer of the integrity i.e. correctness of his data in the cloud. As the data is physically not accessible to the user the cloud should provide a way for the user to check if the integrity of his data is maintained or is compromised. In this paper we provide a scheme which gives a proof of data integrity in the cloud which the customer can employ to check the correctness of his data in the cloud. This proof can be agreed upon by both the cloud and the customer and can be incorporated in the Service level agreement (SLA). This scheme ensures that the storage at the client side is minimal which will be beneficial for thin clients.;;2011;Sravan Kumar, R & Saxena, A;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5716422;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;821;State-of-the-art cloud computing security taxonomies;;;2012;"Srinivasan, Madhan Kumar; Sarukesi, K.; Rodrigues, Paul; Manoj, M.

Supporting application-specific performance goals and SLAs, assigning incoming query processing workloads to the reserved resources to avoid SLA violations and monitoring performance factors to ensure acceptable QoS levels, are some of the critical tasks that have not yet been addressed by the database community. In this position paper, we argue that SLA management for cloud databases should itself be offered to developers as a cloud-based automated service.

Furthermore, another well covered topic is cloud federation concerning processing power and strength. However, the flexibility of the cloud is limited in terms of network services and federated networking between autonomous cloud data-center. With the promising opportunities of Software Defined Networking (SDN), this gap can be closed and enables cloud environments to establish networking federations between autonomous data-centers and virtual network partitioning in a single cloud infrastructure. In this paper we are introducing and describing an architectural approach for a generic layered model and API based software architecture to orchestrate and federate heterogeneous networks. In particular, we present an architecture that enables Quality of Service (QoS) aware configurations of network resources in a cloud infrastructure of one data-center and federated networking between different SDN based cloud networks over and above the data-center network edge. Furthermore, this architecture uses a Service Level Agreement (SLA) protocol and language to expose Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and to negotiate appropriated QoS constrains which are applied to the virtually sliced underlying network substrate. In this way, capabilities of the orchestration and the current utilization of the network are building the foundation for dynamic negotiated SLAs and the within guaranteed QoS of network resources.

These undiscovered performance anomalies afflict many of today's systems, causing violations of service-level agreements (SLAs), unnecessary resource over provisioning, or both. In this paper, we re-inserted realistic anomaly causes into a multi-tier Internet service architecture and studied their manifestations. We observed that each cause had certain workload and management parameters that were more likely to trigger manifestations, hinting that such parameters could be effective classifiers. This observation held even when anomaly causes manifested differently in combination than in isolation. Our study motivates EntomoModel, a framework for depicting performance anomaly manifestations. EntomoModel uses decision tree classification and a design-driven performance model to characterize the workload and management policy settings under which manifestations are likely. EntomoModel enables online system management that avoids anomaly manifestations by dynamically adjusting system management parameters. Our trace-driven evaluations show that manifestation avoidance based on EntomoModel, or entomophobic management, can reduce 98th percentile SLA violations by 67\% compared to an anomaly oblivious adaptive approach.

Yet, consolidation can lead to performance degradation, jeopardizing Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze and identify the factors to the performance degradation due to consolidation - that is the wait time and the ready time. The wait time is the queuing time caused by other virtual machines (VMs). The ready time is the time the resource takes to be ready to service, such as the seek time incurred in traditional storage. The ready time can substantially deteriorate the request response time. Unfortunately, existing schedulers can only manage the wait time, but not the ready time. To control both quantities, we propose an adaptive disk scheduler called DPack. DPack schedules the VMs based on the likelihood of the VM failing the SLAs. DPack then adjusts the exclusive access time based on the VM resource access prediction. DPack considers the workload changes and request arrival to enhance robustness. We develop DPack based on the default disk scheduler in KVM and evaluate it against several existing disk schedulers available in KVM and Xen. The results show that DPack can improve the 99th percentile response time up to 76\%. In the highly consolidated environment, DPack can also satisfy all the SLAs, while the other schedulers cannot meet the SLAs for at least 50\% of the VMs.;;2013;Sukwong, Orathai & Kim, Hyong S.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6566729;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;839;SageShift: Managing SLAs for highly consolidated cloud;Maximizing consolidation ratio, the number of virtual machines (VMs) in a physical machine, without violating customers' SLAs is an important goal in the cloud. We show that it is difficult to achieve this goal with existing hypervisor schedulers. The schedulers control only the amount of resource allocation, but not the sequence of VM execution. This sequence can significantly impact the response time when requests arrive concurrently for the VMs sharing the same CPU. We find that the response time can increase as much as 100\% for every additional VM in the system, even if the utilization does not exceed the maximum capacity. Therefore, existing schedulers have to reduce the consolidation ratio to meet SLAs. Previous resource-provisioning works rely on existing schedulers that cannot guarantee SLAs without reducing the consolidation ratio. We propose SageShift, a system that can achieve SLAs without penalizing the consolidation ratio. SageShift consists of a VM admission control - Sage, and a hypervisor scheduler - Shift. To admit a VM, Sage assesses feasibility of its SLA based on the patterns of incoming requests. Shift maintains the admitted SLAs by adjusting both the amount of resource allocation and the sequence of VM execution. The dynamic adjustment is based on the observed response time and the SLAs. We modify the KVM scheduler in Linux kernel to implement Shift. We show that Shift can improve the consolidation ratio by 66\% without compromising the SLAs. Under bursty incoming requests, Shift maintains all SLAs within 3\% of the percentile target. But existing schedulers in VMware ESXi, Xen and KVM fail to meet one or more SLAs with up to 33\% below the percentile target. Shift is also work-conserving. It allows best-effort VMs to run in the background in order to maximize hardware utilization without impacting SLAs.;;2012;"Sukwong, Orathai; Sangpetch, Akkarit & Kim, Hyong S.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6195591;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;840;Benchmarking Private Cloud Performance with User-Centric Metrics;Cloud computing is a new paradigm for the delivery of IT services.

Benchmarking the cloud requires a well-defined set of cloud performance metrics that should be able to sensitively distinguish the capabilities of cloud systems that enable those features. One way of defining benchmark metrics is based on observations of the internal mechanisms in a cloud. For example, an elasticity evaluation may be based on measuring a resource provisioning interval in the cloud. However, a more meaningful evaluation should be based on user-centric metrics.

The scheduling model is based on service levels that guarantee the quality of service. Each service level is associated to a price per unit of job execution time and a slack factor, which determines the deadline for delivering the results. Once a batch job is submitted to the system, the provider has to decide whether the arriving job can be accepted or must be rejected and processed on external resources. The system maintains the quality of service guarantees for all already accepted jobs. After proposing an original formulation of the problem, we study various schedulers that provide good compromise between income maximization and power consumption minimization. Our experiments and analysis have shown that we can generate schedules with power consumption reduction without degrading the service quality.;;2014;"Tchernykh, Andrei; Lozano, Luz; Bouvry, Pascal; Pecero, Johnatan E.; Schwiegelshohn, Uwe & Nesmachnow, Sergio";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6903786;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;855;Mapping of Cloud Standards to the Taxonomy of Interoperability in IaaS;The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an easy pay-per-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence, consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises. To address these issues, standardization efforts have to take place in order to support further developments in the clouds. Standardized exchange mechanisms and interfaces are crucial in order to facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we look at several cloud standards, such as Open Virtualization Format, Open Cloud Computing Interface, and Cloud Data Management Interface, and analyze them against a taxonomy in order to point out their role for interoperability in IaaS. The taxonomy presents important IaaS topics, such as access mechanism, virtual appliance, security, and service-level agreement.;;2011;"Teckelmann, Ralf; Reich, Christoph & Sulistio, Anthony";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6133187 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2114498.2116170;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;856;Consistency-based service level agreements for cloud storage;;;2013;"Terry, Douglas B.; Prabhakaran, Vijayan; Kotla, Ramakrishna; Balakrishnan, Mahesh; Aguilera, Marcos K. & Abu-Libdeh, Hussam";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.390.3165 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2517349.2522731;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;857;A combined frequency scaling and application elasticity approach for energy-efficient cloud computing;Energy management has become increasingly necessary in large-scale cloud data centers to address high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. In this work, we combine three management techniques that can be used to control cloud data centers in an energy-efficient manner: changing the number of virtual machines, the number of cores, and scaling the CPU frequencies. We present a feedback controller that determines an optimal configuration to minimize energy consumption while meeting performance objectives. The controller can be configured to accomplish these goals in a stable manner, without causing large oscillations in the resource allocations. To meet the needs of individual applications under different workload conditions, the controller parameters are automatically adjusted at runtime based on a system model that is learned online. The potential of the proposed approach is evaluated in a video encoding scenario. The results show that our combined approach achieves up to 34\% energy savings compared to the constituent approaches—core change, virtual machine change, and CPU frequency change policies, while meeting the performance target.;;2014;"Tesfatsion, S.K.; Wadbro, E. & Tordsson, J.";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210537914000481;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;858;Declarative Scheduling in Highly Scalable Systems;;;2010;Tilgner, Christian;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.180.7444;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;859;Switching among Clouds: An Approach to Ensure Cloud Service Portability;;;;"Tilokani, Jitesh; Tech, B.; T, Vii Sem (i. & Gupta, Deepak";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.278.8099;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;860;Engineering autonomic controllers for virtualized web applications;;;2010;"Toffetti, Giovanni; Gambi, Alessio; Pezz\'{e}, Mauro & Pautasso, Cesare";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1884110.1884117;Springer-Verlag;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;861;Revenue Models for Streaming Applications over Shared Clouds;"When multiple users execute their streaming applications over a shared Cloud infrastructure, the provider typically captures the Quality of Service (QoS) for each application at a Service Level Agreement (SLA).

Assuming the maximisation of the revenue as the provider's objective, then it must decide: (i) which user streams to accept for storage and analysis; (ii) how many (computational / storage) resources to allocate to each stream in order to improve overall revenue and minimise cost.

There are multiple reasons for this, including the dynamic adaptability of clouds to the changing demands, their ability to provide resources per need basis and the support for virtualization. By additionally bringing the robust security and chargeback model in it, the cloud becomes a real next generation engine for all e-learning aspects, including database, application and web layers. However, and especially in a hybrid public cloud environments, the right allocation scheme of an e-learning content is critical if the given service level agreement has to be fulfilled. It is by far not enough to distribute content accordingly to the provided amount of processing power of computational nodes and corresponding storage systems. If the content scheduler does not take into account the throughput of the network communication links, the whole system become saturated with waiting times and the response of the cloud based e-learning system degrades. Our approach is to consider both processing power of computational nodes and communication links. The idea is to minimize SLEM, the magnitude of the second largest eigenvalue of the positive symmetric square matrix with elements representing time activities of computational nodes and communication links in parallel processing environment. It shows that this minimization problem can be recast as a semi-definite optimization problem, with ability to find an optimal load distribution of e-learning content.;;2011;"Tomic, D.; Muftic, O. & Biocic, B.";;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;863;CSLAM: A framework for cloud service level agreement management based on WSLA;"With impressive progress of cloud computing and its influence on many aspects of utility computing, many of companies and enterprises are tending to this new product of information technology; some of these companies are interested in consuming cloud services and others tend to provide cloud services. The most common thing for these two major classes of users is service level agreements (SLAs) which are set between them. Many frameworks have been introduced for SLA management in web service level, but there are few applicable frameworks that are specific for cloud computing services. In this paper, we propose a framework for SLA management in cloud computing and especially inter-cloud environments. This framework is based on WSLA which is introduced by IBM, but we have changed it to fit into cloud computing environments. This framework is in fact a component of the cloud computing framework which we have introduced in our previous work.

Starting from some previous works suggesting a model-driven adaptable monitoring framework composed of 3 layers (configurability, adaptability, governability), we introduce a methodology to identify the functional and monitoring high level goals (according to the agreed Service Level Agreement - SLA) in order to drive models' instantiation. This proposal is first applied to a cloud provider case study for which two high level goals are developed (respect metrics freshness and minimize monitoring cost), and then simulated to show how the quality of management decisions, as well as intelligent monitoring of dynamic SLA, could be improved.;;2013;"Toueir, Antoine; Broisin, Julien & Sibilla, Michelle";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6842223;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;865;FSToolkit: adopting software engineering practices for enabling definitions of federated resource infrastructures;;;2012;Tranoris, Christos & Denazis, Spyros;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2340856.2340879;Springer-Verlag;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;866;Cloud based Conceptual Framework of Service Level Agreement for University;;;;Trivedi, Krunal D. & Patel, N J.;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.303.2645;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;867;Binomial distribution approach for efficient detection of service level violations in cloud;Optimum usage of hardware devices, network devices, software resources and consistent quality of service is the aim of cloud computing.

In this context, to justify the cost and to verify the quality of services, active Service Level Management is required. Moreover to overcome unrealistic demands from customers and to surpass the occurring violations, a strong and straight forward approach is needed, through which SLA violations can be noticed, detected and distinguished.

On one hand, cloud providers compete against each other for both existing and new cloud users. To keep existing users and attract newcomers, it is crucial for each provider to offer an optimal price policy which maximizes the final revenue and improves the competitive advantage. The competition among providers leads to the evolution of the market and dynamic resource prices over time. On the other hand, cloud providers may cooperate with each other to improve their final revenue. Based on a service level agreement, a provider can outsource its users' resource requests to its partner to reduce the operation cost and thereby improve the final revenue. This leads to the problem of determining the cooperating parties in a cooperative environment. This paper tackles these two issues of the current cloud market. First, we solve the problem of competition among providers and propose a dynamic price policy. We employ a discrete choice model to describe the user's choice behavior based on his obtained benefit value. The choice model is used to derive the probability of a user choosing to be served by a certain provider. The competition among providers is formulated as a noncooperative stochastic game where the players are providers who act by proposing the price policy simultaneously. The game is modelled as a Markov Decision Process whose solution is a Markov Perfect Equilibrium. Then, we address the cooperation among providers by presenting a novel algorithm for determining a cooperation strategy that tells providers whether to satisfy users' resource requests locally or outsource them to a certain provider. The algorithm yields the optimal cooperation structure from which no provider unilaterally deviates to gain more revenue. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed models.;;2014;Truong-Huu, Tram & Tham, Chen-Khong;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6811199;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;869;Hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements;IT-based Service Economy requires Service Markets to flourish for the trade of services. A market does not represent a simple buyer-seller relationship, rather it is the culmination point of a complex chain of stake-holders with a hierarchical integration of value along each point in the chain. To enable a Service Economy, Service Markets must be practically realized, which in turn requires an enabling infrastructure to support service value chains and service choreographies resulting from service composition scenarios. In such scenarios, services compose together hierarchically in a producer–consumer manner to form service supply-chains of added value. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are defined at various levels in this hierarchy to ensure the expected quality of service for different stakeholders. Automation of service composition directly implies the aggregation of their corresponding SLAs. In this paper we elaborate on the requirements of hierarchical aggregation of SLAs corresponding to service choreographies leading to business models such as Business Value Networks. During the hierarchical aggregation of SLAs, certain SLA information pertaining to different stakeholders is meant to be restricted and can be only partially revealed to a subset of their business partners. We introduce the concept of SLA-Views to protect such privacy concerns. We then formalize the notion of SLA Choreography and define an aggregation model based on SLA-Views to enable the automation of hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements.

Different techniques for increasing the availability in a virtualized system are investigated, quantifying the resulting availability. The results show that depending on the failure rates, different deployment scenarios and fault-tolerance techniques can be used for achieving availability differentiation.

Both problems are modeled as constraint satisfaction problems. The VM provisioning process aims at maximizing a global utility capturing both the performance of the hosted applications with regard to their SLAs and the energy-related operational cost of the cloud computing infrastructure.

A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs.

Applications being delivered as service and hardware and data centers that provides those services [1]. Cloud storage evolves from just a storage model to a new service model where data is being managed, maintained, and stored in multiple remote severs for back-up reasons. Cloud platform server clusters are running in network environment and it may contain multiple users' data and the data may be scattered in different virtual data centers. In a multi-user shared cloud computing platform users are only logically isolated, but data of different users may be stored in same physical equipment. These equipments can be rapidly provisioned, implemented, scaled up or down and decommissioned. Current cloud providers do not provide the control or at least the knowledge over the provided resources to their customers. The data in cloud is encrypted during rest, transit and back-up in multi tenant storage. The encryption keys are managed per customer. There are different stages of data life cycle Create, Store, Use, Share, Archive and Destruct. The final stage is overlooked [2], which is the complex stage of data in cloud. Data retention assurance may be easier for the cloud provider to demonstrate while the data destruction is extremely difficult. When the SLA between the customer and the cloud provider ends, today in no way it is assured that the particular customers' data is completely destroyed or destructed from the cloud provider's storage. The proposed method identifies way to track individual customers' data and their encryption keys and provides solution to completely delete the data from the cloud provider's multi-tenant storage architecture. It also ensures deletion of data copies as there are always possibilities of more than one copy of data being maintained for back-up purposes.

Traditionally, these needs have been addressed by using high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers, which are difficult to setup, maintain, and operate. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS).

This demands for an effective mechanism to establish trust among participants in a high-level abstract way, capturing relevant factors ranging on Service Level Agreement, security policies, requirements, regulations, constraints, Quality of Service, reputation, and recommendation. Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments.

Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey.

Existing approaches, however, do not fully address certain significant issues, such as Service Level Agreements, which tend to be rudimentary, and management of cloud systems, which often lacks sophistication. In this paper, we propose the definition and development of management models that systematically describe the resources, services, usage, and requirements in the context of a cloud storage environment. Furthermore, we introduce content oriented SLA Schemas, which are adapted according to the content term involved in each SLA. Combining all this often heterogeneous information in a smart, structured, and uniform manner can provide significant added value, allowing correlations, links and extraction of useful inferences. We thus propose to incorporate these models in a rich Unified Management Model, which will contribute to optimum decision making, data movement, as well as better resource allocation and energy management, also leading to enhanced Quality of Service.

Although it exhibited anticyclonic flow and featured a warm core at depth, it had been capped at some point during its lifetime, so appeared as a cold feature in the upper 500m. Satellite-derived sea-surface temperatures (SST) showed it to have moved little during the few weeks prior to the cruise. In this paper we discuss the origin of the PRIME eddy including where and when it is likely to have formed. Consistently large amounts of cloud cover restrict the use of SST imagery to track such features. Altimetry provides a better method to trace this eddy back in time and space since microwave radiation is not significantly affected by cloud cover. Sea-level anomaly (SLA) data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON and European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites were used. Results show that the eddy remained almost stationary in the Iceland Basin since first being detected in late 1995 and that it almost certainly formed locally, probably as a result of an instability in the current flow around the northwest of the Hatton Bank. Comparisons between satellite SLAs and hydrographic estimates of sea-surface elevation confirm that the eddy had a substantial barotropic flow. Both the altimeter data and the sea-surface height derived from the acoustic Doppler current profiler agree that the PRIME eddy had a sea-surface elevation of about 20cm and that its diameter was about 120km.;;2001;Wade, Ian P. & Heywood, Karen J.;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064500000941;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;894;Just Satisfactory Resource Provisioning for Parallel Applications in the Cloud;The paper discusses a resource management method at the cloud tenant level. It concerns efficiently running a profitable service on resources leased from a cloud infrastructure provider. Particularly, the paper focuses on services that handle parallelizable client requests, e.g, such a request can be processed using a MPI or a MapReduce program. The objective is to manage resource use to just satisfy the performance requirements of clients and avoid the common over-provisioning or under-provisioning problem. The proposed resource management method makes initial resource leasing plan based on client request profile and performance targets in service level agreements (SLAs). It then dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on monitoring data. Our extensive experiments show that the method is able to provision and efficiently use resources to just satisfy the SLA targets.;;2012;"Wang, Chen; Chen, Junliang; Zhou, Bing Bing & Zomaya, Albert Y.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6274063 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2358963.2359689;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;895;A genetic-based approach to web service composition in geo-distributed cloud environment;Independent fine-grain web services can be integrated to a value-added coarse-grain service through service composition technologies in Service Oriented Architecture. With the advent of cloud computing, more and more web services in cloud may provide the same function but differ in performance. In addition, the development of cloud computing presents a geographically distributed manner, which elevates the impact of the network on the QoS of composited web services. Therefore, a significant research problem in service composition is how to select the best candidate service from a set of functionally equivalent services in terms of a service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we propose a composition model that takes both QoS of services and cloud network environment into consideration.

Cloud computing is gaining popularity due to its low cost, high reliability and wide availability. However, a serious impediment to its wider deployment is the relative lack of effective data management services. The relatively slow access to persistent data and large variability in cloud storage I/O performance, can significantly degrade the performance of data-intensive applications. This paper addresses the problem of I/O performance fluctuation and proposes an automatic optimization schema for cloud storage called AOSC, which utilizes data chunking, placement, and replication to achieve more stable and predictable performance.

Through virtualization technology, server consolidation can reduce physical hosts and provide scalable services. However, the ineffective memory usage among multiple virtual machines (VMs) becomes the bottleneck in server consolidation environment. Because of inaccurate memory usage estimate and the lack of memory resource managements, there is much service performance degradation in data centers, even though they have occupied a large amount of memory. In order to improve this scenario, we first introduce VM's memory division view and VM's free memory division view. Based on them, we propose a hierarchal memory service mechanism. We have designed and implemented the corresponding memory scheduling algorithm to enhance memory efficiency and achieve service level agreement. The benchmark test results show that our implementation can save 30\% physical memory with 1\% to 5\% performance degradation.

Thus we present a platform of Services Level Agreement (SLA) in cloud computing. In the platform, we propose a Reputation System to evaluate the reliability of providers or resources to address this challenge, and we also propose a SLA template pool in order to make the SLA negotiation between cloud providers and cloud consumers become more equitable, transparent and convenient.;;2011;"Wang, MinChao; Wu, Xing; Zhang, Wu; Ding, FuQiang; Zhou, Jun & Pei, GuoCai";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2114495.2115466 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6118731;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;900;Response Time Reliability in Cloud Environments: An Empirical Study of n-Tier Applications at High Resource Utilization;When running mission-critical web-facing applications (e.g., electronic commerce) in cloud environments, predictable response time, e.g., specified as service level agreements (SLA), is a major performance reliability requirement. Through extensive measurements of n-tier application benchmarks in a cloud environment, we study three factors that significantly impact the application response time predictability: bursty workloads (typical of web-facing applications), soft resource management strategies (e.g., global thread pool or local thread pool), and bursts in system software consumption of hardware resources (e.g., Java Virtual Machine garbage collection). Using a set of profit-based performance criteria derived from typical SLAs, we show that response time reliability is brittle, with large response time variations (order of several seconds) depending on each one of those factors. For example, for the same workload and hardware platform, modest increases in workload burstiness may result in profit drops of more than 50\%. Our results show that profitbased performance criteria may contribute significantly to the successful delimitation of performance unreliability boundaries and thus support effective management of clouds.;;2012;"Wang, Qingyang; Kanemasa, Yasuhiko; Li, Jack; Jayasinghe, Deepal; Kawaba, Motoyuki & Pu, Calton";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.304.4651 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2477173.2477523 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6424878;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;901;Service Level Agreement-Based Joint Application Environment Assignment and Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Systems;;excluded;;"Wang, Yanzhi; Chen, Shuang & Pedram, Massoud";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.408.3911;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;902;A Game Theoretic Framework of SLA-based Resource Allocation for Competitive Cloud Service Providers;Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that allows the on-demand delivering of software, hardware, and data as services. It has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the increasing demand for high performance computing and storage. Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the cloud computing system, especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. A set of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) in the cloud, such as Google or Amazon, may support the similar type of application, and therefore, service requests generated from the network edges are free to be dispatched to any CSP in the set. This paper considers the problem of SLA-based resource provisioning and management among different CSPs. Each CSP owns a set of potentially heterogeneous servers supporting a common application type, and each performs resource allocation in these servers for request processing. In the cloud, a central request dispatcher allocates service requests to different servers (belonging to potentially different CSPs) based on the amounts of allocated resources in those servers. Each CSP optimizes its own profit, which is the total revenue obtained from servicing the clients subtracted by the total energy cost. The total revenue depends on the average service request response time as specified in the SLAs. The resource allocation problem among multiple CSPs forms a competitive normal-form game, since the payoff (profit) of each CSP depends not only on its own resource allocation results but also on the actions of the other CSPs. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in this game are proved. Each CSP will find its optimal strategy at the Nash equilibrium point using the convex optimization technique.

However, the negotiation process for customers is a significant task particularly when there are multiple SaaS providers in the Cloud market, as service cost and quality are constantly changing and consumers have varying needs. Therefore, we propose a novel automated negotiation framework where a SaaS broker is utilized as the one-stop-shop for customers to achieve the required service efficiently when negotiating with multiple providers. The automated negotiation framework facilitates intelligent bilateral bargaining of SLAs between a SaaS broker and multiple providers to achieve different objectives for different participants. To maximize profit and improve customer satisfaction levels for the broker, we propose the design of counter offer generation strategies and decision making heuristics that take into account time, market constraints and trade-off between QoS parameters.

In this paper, we address the issue of how to intelligently manage the resources in a shared cloud database system and present SmartSLA, a cost-aware resource management system. SmartSLA consists of two main components: the system modeling module and the resource allocation decision module. The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model that describes the potential profit margins for each client under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocation decision module dynamically adjusts the resource allocations in order to achieve the optimum profits. We evaluate SmartSLA by using the TPC-W benchmark with workload characteristics derived from real-life systems. The performance results indicate that SmartSLA can successfully compute predictive models under different hardware resource allocations, such as CPU and memory, as well as database specific resources, such as the number of replicas in the database systems.

First, there is an inherent optimization conflict between cost of resources and Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Second, the resource demands of the multiple tiers can be different from each other, and varying along with the time. Resources have to be allocated to multiple (virtual) containers to minimize the total amount of resources while meeting the end-to-end performance requirements for the application. In this paper we address these two challenges through the combination of the resource controllers on both application and container levels. On the application level, a decision maker (i.e., an adaptive feedback controller) determines the total budget of the resources that are required for the application to meet SLA requirements as the workload varies. On the container level, a second controller partitions the total resource budget among the components of the applications to optimize the application performance (i.e., to minimize the round trip time). We evaluated our method with three different workload models -- open, closed, and semi-open - that were implemented in the RUBiS web application benchmark. Our evaluation indicates two major advantages of our method in comparison to previous approaches. First, fewer resources are provisioned to the applications to achieve the same performance.

Although recent studies have primarily focused on harnessing live migration of VMs to achieve load balancing and power saving among different servers, there has been little attention on the incurred performance interference and cost on both source and destination servers during and after such VM migration. To avoid potential violations of service-level-agreement (SLA) demanded by cloud applications, this paper proposes iAware, a lightweight interference-aware VM live migration strategy. It empirically captures the essential relationships between VM performance interference and key factors that are practically accessible through realistic experiments of benchmark workloads on a Xen virtualized cluster platform. iAware jointly estimates and minimizes both migration and co-location interference among VMs, by designing a simple multi-resource demand-supply model. Extensive experiments and complementary large-scale simulations are conducted to validate the performance gain and runtime overhead of iAware in terms of I/O and network throughput, CPU consumption, and scalability, compared to the traditional interference-unaware VM migration approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate that iAware is flexible enough to cooperate with existing VM scheduling or consolidation policies in a complementary manner, such that the load balancing or power saving can still be achieved without sacrificing performance.;;2014;"Xu, Fei; Liu, Fangming; Liu, Linghui; Jin, Hai; Li, Bo & Li, Baochun";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6598665;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;924;A Time Interval-Based Credit Reservation Approach for Prepaid Composite Services in Cloud Environments;A typical business model in cloud environments for service providers is the provision of composite services built from resources and services offered by other providers. Customers of these composite services can make an advance payment before consumption. In this scenario, accounting systems will supervise each service comprising given composite services individually. As the number of constituent services and requests submitted by customers increase dramatically, scalability issues arise. To tackle this problem, we present an approach that estimates the highest cost of a given composite service composed of multiple pre-paid services, and then calculates the duration of a time interval based on which accounting systems access and update target customers' account. It is intended to reduce overhead imposed by supervising services individually in real-time.

It is challenging to realize effective energy consumption and energy efficiency aware autonomic cloud application service level agreement assurance mechanism. In this paper, we propose energy aware cloud application management architecture for private cloud data center. Furthermore we present a cloud application and power management model. In order to metering server energy utility efficiency and cloud applications' total energy consumption of running on a specific group of servers, we define related measurement metrics. The objective of our approach is to reduce data center's total energy efficiency by controlling cloud applications' overall energy consumption while ensuring cloud applications' service level agreement.

This can be problematic because activity from geographically distributed terminals owing to globalization often increases the average response time. Federating various clouds enables to utilize datacenters in various geographical regions regardless of their servicers. The response time can be reduced by replicating the applications and related data at datacenters near the terminals by considering the factors of delay (e.g., data synchronization, distribution of multi-tier applications, and influence of other applications). However, it is unrealistic to accurately analyze all of the factors without any errors. We propose wide area tentative scaling (WATS) to improve the response time in a phased manner by repetitively replicate a part of the application and related data at other datacenters and selecting a better organization. The WATS approach is to repetitively change the organization to reduce the response time even if the analysis is incorrect, unlike mathematical-formulae-based approaches that require precise analysis. The drawback of this approach is that it consumes more computing resources due to repeating the replication. We therefore, applied Bayesian inference to search for a better organization with fewer trials. Evaluation results showed that WATS successfully reduced the response time in a phased manner.;;2014;"Yabusaki, Hitoshi; Nakagoe, Hiroshi; Murayama, Koichi & Kato, Takatoshi";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6849164;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;927;Cluster Energy Optimization: An Algorithmic Approach;;;;"Yadav, Vikram; Sahoo, G. & Mukherjee, K.";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.403.2751;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;928;Destination selection algorithm in a server migration service;;;2012;"Yamanaka, Asato; Fukushima, Yukinobu; Murase, Tutomu; Yokohira, Tokumi & Suda, Tatsuya";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2377310.2377315;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;929;Trusted SLA Monitoring for Billing System in Public Cloud computing Environment;;;;Yamini, U. & Sathiyapriya, K.;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.416.8816;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;930;iMeter: An integrated VM power model based on performance profiling;The unprecedented burst in power consumption encountered by contemporary datacenters continually boosts the development of energy efficient techniques from both hardware and software perspectives to alleviate the energy problem. The most widely adopted power saving solutions in datacenters that deliver cloud computing services are power capping and VM consolidation. However, without the capability to track the VM power usage precisely, the combined effect of the above two techniques could cause severe performance degradation to the consolidated VMs, thus violating the user service level agreements. In this paper, we propose an integrated VM power model called iMeter, which overcomes the drawbacks of overpresumption and overapproximation in segregated power models used in previous studies. We leverage the kernel-based performance counters that provide accurate performance statistics as well as high portability across heterogeneous platforms to build the VM power model. Principal component analysis is applied to identify performance counters that show strong impact on the VM power consumption with mathematical confidence. We also present a brief interpretation of the first four selected principal components on their indications of VM power consumption. We demonstrate that our approach is independent of underlying hardware and virtualization configurations with clustering analysis. We utilize the support vector regression to build the VM power model predicting the power consumption of both a single VM and multiple consolidated VMs running various workloads. The experimental results show that our model is able to predict the instantaneous VM power usage with an average error of 5\% and 4.7\% respectively against the actual power measurement.;;2014;"Yang, Hailong; Zhao, Qi; Luan, Zhongzhi & Qian, Depei";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13001532;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;931;iMeter: An Integrated VM Power Model Based on Performance Profiling;;excluded;2013;"Yang, Hailong; Zhao, Qi; Luan, Zhongzhi; Qian, Depei; Xie, Ming; Mars, Jason & Tang, Lingjia";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2570457.2571069;IEEE Computer Society;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;932;A cost-aware auto-scaling approach using the workload prediction in service clouds;;;2013;"Yang, Jingqi; Liu, Chuanchang; Shang, Yanlei; Cheng, Bo; Mao, Zexiang; Liu, Chunhong; Niu, Lisha & Chen, Junliang";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2598717.2598750;Kluwer Academic Publishers;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;933;Workload Predicting-Based Automatic Scaling in Service Clouds;Service platforms have disadvantages such as they have long construction periods, low resource utilizations and isolated constructions.

In order to achieve the scalability, we need to know when and how to scale virtual resources assigned to different services. In this paper, a linear regression model is used to predict the workload. Based on this predicted workload, an auto-scaling mechanism is proposed to scale virtual resources at different resource levels in service clouds.

Accountability in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a capability of making business processes across all participants (services, applications and people) accountable in terms of both business logic and Quality of Services (QoS). While accountability is a critical mechanism to enhance trust between collaborative services, there is the lack of standard accountability support in the current SOA infrastructure. For example, it is difficult with the existing technologies/infrastructure to resolve a dispute between two (web) services if some interactions between the two services go wrong; there is also little existing accountability support for a service consumer to collect quantity evidences to complain a service provider, who fails to meet its Service Level Agreement (SLA). As the increasing real-world activities are performed through the Internet connected services, we envision that there will be growing requirements for making the behaviors of both service providers and consumers accountable. In the business world, one may be reluctant to transact directly with a stranger. But a mutually trusted middleman can be used to facilitate transactions and resolve possible disputes. In this tutorial, we will share our observations and research results on building accountability into SOA. First, we will review related work on accountability in traditional distributed systems, ranging from Internet protocols and network file systems to outsourced database management systems. We will examine what methods embodied in these work can fit service computing in Internet scale and what cannot. Then we will present our research work on middleman-based approach to delivering accountability as a service, including our recent research results. This tutorial will focus on the major technical challenges of enabling SOA accountable and our solutions to these challenges.

The self-service feature inherent in Cloud systems allows customers to play a greater role in service procurement. However, this restricts the value propositions and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that Cloud providers offer because Quality of Service (QoS) and Non Functional Property (NFP) requirements vary from customer to customer. In feature-rich SLA templates, the contract space gets large, objectives are confidential and preferences over QoS and NFP often conflict between providers and customers. Hence, an SLA-gap exists between the two and contemporary providers bind their offerings to the inflexible take-it-or-leave-it SLAs. In this work, we address this problem by presenting a robust and computationally inexpensive negotiation strategy, using which agents can efficiently create near-optimal SLAs under time constraints. Experimental evaluations validate that our strategy performs at par with state of the art learning and non-learning strategies against a variety of metrics including utility, social welfare, social utility and the Pareto-optimal bids. This enables a dynamic SLA negotiation mechanism on top of our OpenShift (PaaS) based Cloud system designed using Service Oriented Cloud Computing Infrastructure (SOCCI) architecture.

This paper addresses the reconciliation objectives by proposing a profit-driven resource scheduling method for virtualized cloud systems. Compared with traditional methods, our method aims at maximizing the revenues by introducing SLA and the cost of renting cloud resource, instead of increasing resource utilization or decreasing early finishing time. We model the performance of applications with queueing theory; calculate the revenues according to the SLA and renting cost; adjust the amount of virtual resources to adapt to dynamic workloads in period.

Specially, with cloud computing, service providers no longer need to maintain a large number of expensive physical machines, which can significantly reduce the cost. However, due to the fluctuation and uncertainty of the future demands, it is still a challenge for service providers to dynamically determine the optimal resource provisioning to save cost while guaranteeing the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Overload may result in the service unavailable for the latter service requests while over-provisioning naturally increases the cost. To address the problem, in this paper, by defining the unavailability probability of the service as a metric of SLA, we propose a SLA-driven dynamic VMs provisioning strategy based on the large deviation principle, which is capable of proactive calculating the optimal number of VMs for the upcoming demands subject to the unavailability probability below a desired threshold.

A SaaS that is delivered as composite application has many benefits including reduced delivery costs, flexible offers of the SaaS functions and decreased subscription cost for users. However, this approach has introduced a new problem in managing the resources allocated to the composite SaaS. The resource allocation that has been done at the initial stage may be overloaded or wasted due to the dynamic environment of a Cloud. A typical data center resource management usually triggers a placement reconfiguration for the SaaS in order to maintain its performance as well as to minimize the resource used.

These technologies can be divided into three parts: storage protect, transfer protect and authorize.;;2011;"Zhang, Xiao; Du, Hong-tao; Chen, Jian-quan; Lin, Yi & Zeng, Lei-jie";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2005869.2006058 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5948734;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;958;A Relationship-Based VM Placement Framework of Cloud Environment;"Managing computation resources in a cost-effective way has become the core competence for a Cloud provider to win over the market because of the ""pay-as-you-go"" business model. Therefore, VM placement has become more and more important in the research and practices of VM management by determining at what condition and on which physical server a VM should be placed so that the SLA can be guaranteed and servers' utilization can be improved. Much existing work simply formulates the above issue to be a bin-packing problem, which does not take the VM relationships into account. However, the relationship information can greatly impact the SLA of the Cloud system and the resource utilization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a relationship-based VM placement framework, SmartCRS, to optimize the VM placement procedure. SmartCRS reveals the relationships between VMs automatically. Then by using such information and based on a constraint library, it gives a proper VM placement plan. Finally, the plan is carried out by SmartCRS automatically or by Cloud administrators manually to improve the server utilization and guarantee the required SLA. Two case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework at the end of this paper.";;2013;"Zhang, Xiaodong; Zhang, Ying; Chen, Xing; Liu, Kai; Huang, Gang & Zhan, Jianfeng";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2546398.2546489 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6649807;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;959;SLA-Driven State Monitoring for Cloud Services;Witnessing the great growth of cloud services, providers are faced with the state monitoring for a diversity of services from federated clouds. Since the consumers might have individual SLA requirements on its applications, the state monitoring of service has become a demanding work in the cloud. In this paper, we present a SLA-driven state monitoring framework for cloud service based on the matrix factorization model, which employs a boosting WCGD algorithm to optimize the monitoring results. Our approach not only contributes to improving the monitoring accuracy, but also takes less overhead during the communication. As demonstrated in our experiment, our framework proves to be efficient and adapts to the dynamical network environment. Compared with existing approaches, we are the first to conduct the state monitoring based on the matrix factorization model.;;2013;"Zhang, Yuchao; Liu, Hongfu; Lu, Yuruo & Deng, Bo";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6831950;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;960;DifferCloudStor: Differentiated quality of service for cloud storage;For a large scale cloud cluster, providing data access which crosses through high performance computing servers, network and storage servers, and scheduling resources among multi-tenants are challenging jobs, especially with specific level of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. Besides the criteria of current availability and reliability in service level agreement (SLA), throughput and latency are also critical QoS performance measurements to the tenants. Any QoS solution, unfortunately cannot be achieved without introducing additional overhead. A good QoS design should always be cost effective. This paper proposes a cost-effective QoS infrastructure over distributed storage system, providing work-conserving differentiated QoS for multi-tenants cloud storage. The proposed QoS infrastructure combines global service differentiation with adaptive share allocation to support differentiated QoS, and achieves both service isolation among users from same class and service differentiation among users from different classes.;;2013;"Zhang, Yu; Ren, Shu Qin; Chen, Shi Bin; Tan, Benjamin; Lim, En Sheng; Yong, Khai Leong; Yu Zhang; Shu Qin Ren; Shi Bin Chen; En Sheng Lim & Khai Leong Yong";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6522250;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;961;An adaptive power management framework for autonomic resource configuration in cloud computing infrastructures;Power is becoming an increasingly important concern for large-scale cloud computing systems. Meanwhile, cloud service providers leverage virtualization technologies to facilitate service consolidation and enhance resource utilization. However, the introduction of virtualization makes the cloud infrastructure more complex, and thus challenges cloud power management. In a virtualized environment, resource needs to be configured at runtime at the cloud, server and virtual machine levels to achieve high power efficiency. In addition, cloud power management should guarantee high users' SLA (service level agreement) satisfaction. In this paper, we present an adaptive power management framework in the cloud to achieve autonomic resource configuration. We propose a software and lightweight approach to accurately estimate the power usage of virtual machines and cloud servers. It explores hypervisor-observable performance metrics to build the power usage model. To configure cloud resources, we consider both the system power usage and the SLA requirements, and leverage learning techniques to achieve autonomic resource allocation and optimal power efficiency. We implement a prototype of the proposed power management system and test it on a cloud testbed. Experimental results show the high accuracy (over 90\%) of our power usage estimation mechanism and our resource configuration approach achieves the lowest energy usage among the compared four approaches.;;2012;"Zhang, Ziming; Guan, Qiang & Fu, Song";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6407738;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;962;Policy-based adaptive service level agreement management for cloud services;For delivering scalable, reliable and on-demand services, cloud services are becoming more and more prevalent. Due to dynamic and flexibility in cloud environment, Service Level Agreement (SLA) plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) level agreed by participants. Though lots of work on SLA management, few of them have adapted well in such an environment. In this study, we present a novel policy-based adaptive approach to solve the problem, and introduce a contract template embedded with policy to handle the changes of service provision and participants' requirement. In this way, we illustrate how the policy enables adaptive SLA management. This approach dynamically perceives alterations of SLAs parameters and adjusts them accordingly. Thus, service providers can maximize the resources and consumers could get the best price. Finally, our proposal is evaluated and its advantages are shown.;;2014;"Zhang, Zhenling; Liao, Lejian; Liu, Hai & Li, Guoqiang";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6933614;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;963;A statistical based resource allocation scheme in cloud;Recently, cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm on the Internet. With the development of cloud computing, enterprise data centers shift towards a utility computing model where many critical business applications share a common pool of infrastructure resources offering capacity on demand. The virtual machine with the features of strong isolation and flexible is usually assigned as the basic unit. However, as the demand of each type of VM can fluctuate independently at run time, it becomes a challenging problem to allocate data center resources to each VM to balance the workload in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce an approach (Statistic based Load Balance, SLB) that makes use of the statistical prediction and available resource evaluation mechanism to make online resource allocation decisions. Unlike the methods that balance load based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) of VMs, SLB achieves load balancing by predicting the VM's resource demand. The approach includes two parts:(1) A data analysis of on-line historical performance for forecasting the resource demand of each VM, and (2) An algorithm for choosing a proper host in the resource pool to run the VM. Experiments show that SLB can perform load balance in time, and also perform more balanced use of different resources.;excluded;2011;"Zhang, Zhenzhong; Wang, Haiyan; Xiao, Limin & Ruan, Li";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2354417.2355564 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6138531;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;964;Cost-Aware Dynamic Virtual Machine Purchase Plan Orchestrator for Multi-tier Cloud Applications;Cloud deployment and multi-tier architecture are popular for web applications. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers users different Virtual Machine (VM) instances with various capacities and prices which can be used as servers in each tier of web applications. Because of heterogeneousness of workload in each tier, it poses a great challenge to choose suitable VM purchase plans for each tier as to adapt the varying workload and reduce the cost of VM usage. In this paper, we propose a new approach which conducts cost-aware dynamic VM purchase plans for multi-tier cloud applications. Our approach first uses reinforcement learning to generate several candidate plans to adapt the varying workload and then employs linear programming to find the optimal one which is the most money-saving among the candidates. The experiment results witness the proposed method gains better performance than the traditional threshold method in meeting the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and cutting down the cost.;;2013;"Zhao, He; Peng, Chenglei; Yu, Yao; Zhou, Yu; Wang, Ziqiang & Du, Sidan";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2569433.2569898 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686078;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;965;Cost-Aware Automatic Virtual Machine Scaling in Fine Granularity for Cloud Applications;It is a tendency for enterprises to deploy their applications on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platforms.

In this paper, based on the observation that the workload of nowaday applications fluctuates frequently, we propose a cost-aware automatic VM scaling method of fine granularity to satisfy the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and minimize the rent of VMs down to the minute. In the environment with sporadic and sharp swings of workload, our approach acts quickly to get suitable VM scaling scheme to stabilize the response time, reduce the SLA violations and save the rent of VM usage.;;2013;"Zhao, He; Peng, Chenglei; Yu, Yao; Zhou, Yu; Wang, Ziqiang & Du, Sidan";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2546918.2547011 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6685667;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;966;A Framework for Consumer-Centric SLA Management of Cloud-Hosted Databases;Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. The specifications of existing service level agreements (SLA) for cloud services are not designed to flexibly handle even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. In this article, we present a novel approach for SLA-based management of cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. The framework facilitates adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. In this framework, the SLA of the consumer applications are declaratively defined in terms of goals which are subjected to a number of constraints that are specific to the application requirements. The framework continuously monitors the application-defined SLA and automatically triggers the execution of necessary corrective actions (scaling out/in the database tier) when required. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLA-based framework in providing the consumer applications with the required flexibility for achieving their SLA requirements.;;2013;"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.380.3204 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6461875;;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;967;Consumer-centric SLA manager for cloud-hosted databases;;;2013;"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2505515.2508196;ACM Press;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;968;Application-Managed Replication Controller for Cloud-Hosted Databases;Data replication is a well-known strategy to achieve the availability, scalability and performance improvement goals in the data management world. However, the cost of maintaining several database replicas always strongly consistent is very high. The CAP theorem shows that a shared-data system can choose at most two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and tolerance to partitions. In practice, most of the cloud-based data management systems tend to overcome the difficulties of distributed replication by relaxing the consistency guarantees of the system. In particular, they implement various forms of weaker consistency models such as eventual consistency. This solution is accepted by many new Web 2.0 applications (e.g. social networks) which could be more tolerant with a wider window of data staleness (replication delay).However, unfortunately, there are no generic application-independent and consumer-centric mechanisms by which software applications can specify and manage to what extent inconsistencies can be tolerated. We introduce an adaptive framework for database replication at the middleware layer of cloud environments. The framework provides flexible mechanisms to enable software applications of keeping several database replicas (that can be hosted in different data centers) with different levels of service level agreements (SLA) for their data freshness. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in providing the software applications with the required flexibility to achieve and optimize their requirements in terms of overall system throughput, data freshness and invested monetary cost.;;2012;"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.380.4568 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353821 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253597;IEEE;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;969;Cloud Data Management;;;2014;"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif; Liu, Anna & Bouguettaya, Athman";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2602254;Springer Publishing Company, Incorporated;SLA and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;970;Meeting service level agreement cost-effectively for video-on-demand applications in the cloud;Increasingly video-on-demand (VoD) applications have been ported to cloud platforms.

In this paper we propose an approach that aims to solve the fundamental resource reservation and scheduling problem of configuring the cloud utility to meet SLAs for VoD applications at a modest cost. First, we devise a constraint-based model that describes the relationship among channel placement, user groups' bandwidth allocation, operating costs and QoS constraints. Second, we present a distributed heuristic algorithm, called DREAM, that solves the model and produces a budget solution that reserves and allocates cloud bandwidth, and determines the channel layout among datacenters.

In this paper, we consider a situation in a data center where multiple user applications are executing on a multi-core system and each application may have a specified SLA requirement. We design a voltage and frequency scheduler (the “cool” scheduler) that can be used in enterprise data centers to provide CPU energy saving under the specified SLA requirement by exploiting the applications' run-time program phases. Our design greatly improves the computation efficiency compared to other recently published works. The scheduler is built into the Linux kernel and evaluated against SPEC CPU2006 and Phoronix Test Suite on a quad-core system. Experiment result demonstrates that our cool scheduler achieves 25.8\% energy saving on average with 8.7\% performance loss under the given SLA requirement (10\% allowed performance loss).

The work was carried out in a pine forest stand within the coastal area of San Rossore (Central Italy) using both conventionally collected and remotely sensed data. The calibration of the model was performed using estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) derived from the carbon accumulated in the forest stems during the last four decades. Such estimates were obtained by transforming dendrochronological measurements collected in the stand into annual increments of woody biomass and carbon matter. Next, the model performance was validated against values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) collected during four years (1999–2002) by an eddy covariance flux tower. A method based on deriving fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) from remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was also calibrated and validated in order to more directly assess forest GPP. The results achieved indicate that the multi-year calibration against past carbon accumulation was essential in properly configuring the model in terms of respiration and allocation functions. Due to the importance of these functions, only the calibrated model was in fact able to correctly simulate the forest carbon fluxes, giving monthly estimates of both NEE and GPP quite close to those measured by the flux tower.

To minimize this cost, we identify the following essential scalability properties: (i) only replicas updated by a transaction T make steps to execute T; (ii) a read-only transaction never waits for concurrent transactions and always commits; (iii) a transaction may read object versions committed after it started; and (iv) two transactions synchronize with each other only if their writes conflict.

As Clouds/Grids are distributed over wide-area networks, communication cost usually dominates overall query response time. Therefore we can expect that query performance can be improved by minimizing communication cost. In our method, DIS uses a data flow style query execution model. Each query plan is mapped to a group of $\mu$Engines, each of which is a program corresponding to a particular operator. Thus, multiple sub-queries from concurrent queries are able to share $\mu$Engines. We reconstruct these sub-queries to exploit overlapping data among them. As a result, all the sub-queries can obtain their results, and overall communication overhead can be reduced. Experimental results show that, when DIS runs a group of parameterized queries, our reconstructing algorithm can reduce the average query completion time by 32–48\%; when DIS runs a group of non-parameterized queries, the average query completion time of queries can be reduced by 25–35\%.";;2011;"Chen, Gang; Wu, Yongwei; Liu, Jia; Yang, Guangwen & Zheng, Weimin";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804510001050 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1988082.1988316;Academic Press Ltd.;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1021;Ontology-based Information Sharing in Service-Oriented Database Systems;This paper presents a novel information sharing framework using Service-Oriented Database System (SODB) for service registry and repository that facilitates data integration.

Distributed databases, such as Google Spanner, scale to millions of nodes that replicate data across datacentres possibly located on different continents. At this scale, it is infeasible to maintain serialisability, which assumes that a global total order over committed transactions can be established. Instead, weaker consistency models, such as eventual consistency, causal consistency, sequential consistency and external consistency, are assumed. The problem is that operational models, such as labelled transition systems, tend to assume an interleaving semantics, which serialises transactions. To address this limitation, we provide an operational model that allows a weaker notion of consistency for a geographically distributed database inspired by Spanner.

However, due to legacy and proprietary software, storage and decommissioning costs, and the price of centralization and redevelopment, it remains complex, expensive, and often unfeasible for hospitals to deploy their infrastructure for online and mobile use. This paper proposes the SparkMed data integration framework for mobile healthcare (m-Health), which significantly benefits from the enhanced network capabilities of LTE wireless technologies, by enabling a wide range of heterogeneous medical software and database systems (such as the picture archiving and communication systems, hospital information system, and reporting systems) to be dynamically integrated into a cloud-like peer-to-peer multimedia data store. Our framework allows medical data applications to share data with mobile hosts over a wireless network (such as WiFi and 3G), by binding to existing software systems and deploying them as m-Health applications. SparkMed integrates techniques from multimedia streaming, rich Internet applications (RIA), and remote procedure call (RPC) frameworks to construct a Self-managing, Pervasive Automated netwoRK for Medical Enterprise Data (SparkMed). Further, it is resilient to failure, and able to use mobile and handheld devices to maintain its network, even in the absence of dedicated server devices. We have developed a prototype of the SparkMed framework for evaluation on a radiological workflow simulation, which uses SparkMed to deploy a radiological image viewer as an m-Health application for telemedical use by radiologists and stakeholders.

This new paradigm presents numerous opportunities that even traditional businesses like telecoms cannot ignore, in particular, enabling new and more cost effective solutions to old problems. The work presented in this paper provides a detailed description of how a telecom application can be migrated to a NoSQL database.

Today's organizations consume an increasing share of their computing resources as computing services, using an ondemand model and paying only for what they use. They consume cloud business applications and processes, and store and analyze vast amounts of information on cloud provisioned resources. Cloud computing is dramatically reducing the capital required to support IT operations, while bringing unprecedented openness, flexibility and access to enterprise computing. One of the paradoxes of this new environment is that openness and easy access to services and resources results in the creation of new barriers and computing silos. New 'born in the cloud' enterprises are quickly discovering the difficulty of integrating SaaS services into their daily operations in efficient, secure and reliable ways. SaaS APIs are as siloed as traditional enterprise applications, if not more. Data is still represented in heterogeneous formats and kept in multiple application stores. Thus, while access and delivery have fundamentally improved, the core problems of process and data integration remain. If anything, they are getting harder. Successful technologies for process and data integration in the cloud will differ fundamentally from existing approaches for enterprise integration. While existing approaches focus on eliminating silos and leveling access to process and information, cloud integration will acknowledge barriers as the price of extending our reach beyond the limits a single organization and focus on linking capabilities and information. Instead of reengineering processes, new process integration technology will link processes and application services offered by specialized providers, leveraging instead of replacing available processes. Instead of coercing heterogeneous information into unified schemas, the new approach to information integration will link enterprise data and open data to offer virtual access to much richer informa- ion set. New cloud integration services are already being built leveraging a collection of technologies born on the Web and also within the enterprise. They include ""low touch"" technologies such as process correlation and mining, process analytics, linked and open data, and provenance among others. This keynote will discuss trends in SaaS and cloud-based integration, and review some of the foundational technologies that can support a new cloud centric data and application integration paradigm.";;2013;Curbera, Francisco;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6658268;IEEE;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1032;Web Information Systems and Mining;;;2012;Dai, Jian & Du, Shuanzhu;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2406510.2406567;Springer Berlin Heidelberg;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1033;Track fusion in multisensor-multitarget tracking;;;2011;Danu, Daniel G.;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2231660;McMaster University;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1034;Android Wireless Application Development Volume II: Advanced Topics;;;2012;Darcey, Lauren & Conder, Shane;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2424119;Addison-Wesley Professional;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1035;Large-scale linked data integration using probabilistic reasoning and crowdsourcing;;;2013;"Demartini, Gianluca; Difallah, Djellel Eddine & Cudr\'{e}-Mauroux, Philippe";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2557770.2557784;Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1036;Principles of Data Integration;;;2012;"Doan, AnHai; Halevy, Alon & Ives, Zachary";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124160446000107;Elsevier;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1037;Watershed Reanalysis: Towards a National Strategy for Model-Data Integration;Reanalysis or retrospective analysis is the process of re-analyzing and assimilating climate and weather observations with the current modeling context.

These services depend on integrating data from multiple sources in a fast and efficient way to be able to provide the accepted level of service performance it is committed to. As the size of data available on different environments increases, and systems are heterogeneous and autonomous, data integration becomes a crucial part of most modern systems. Data integration systems can benefit from innovative dynamic infrastructure solutions such as Clouds, with its more agility, lower cost, device independency, location independency, and scalability.

One of the most challenging issues in data sharing systems is the enforcement of access policies and the support of policies updates. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is becoming a promising cryptographic solution to this issue. It enables data owners to define their own access policies over user attributes and enforce the policies on the data to be distributed. However, the advantage comes with a major drawback which is known as a key escrow problem. The key generation center could decrypt any messages addressed to specific users by generating their private keys. This is not suitable for data sharing scenarios where the data owner would like to make their private data only accessible to designated users. In addition, applying CP-ABE in the data sharing system introduces another challenge with regard to the user revocation since the access policies are defined only over the attribute universe. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel CP-ABE scheme for a data sharing system by exploiting the characteristic of the system architecture. The proposed scheme features the following achievements: 1) the key escrow problem could be solved by escrow-free key issuing protocol, which is constructed using the secure two-party computation between the key generation center and the data-storing center, and 2) fine-grained user revocation per each attribute could be done by proxy encryption which takes advantage of the selective attribute group key distribution on top of the ABE. The performance and security analyses indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient to securely manage the data distributed in the data sharing system.;;2013;Hur, Junbeom;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5740890 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2553857.2553865;IEEE Educational Activities Department;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1058;Hybrid Cloud For Dummies;;;2012;"Hurwitz, Judith; Kaufman, Marcia; Halper, Fern & Kirsch, Dan";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2385826;For Dummies;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1059;Towards Privacy Preserving Mining over Distributed Cloud Databases;Due to great advances in computing and Internet technologies, organizations have been enabled to collect and generate a large amount of data. Most of these organizations tend to analyze their data to discover new patterns. Usually, analyzing such amount of data requires huge computational power and storage facilities that may not be available to these organizations. Cloud computing offers the best way to solve this problem. Storing the private data of different organizations in the same cloud server enhances the mining process, but at the same time, raises privacy concerns. Therefore, it is highly recommended to support privacy preserving data mining algorithms in the cloud environment. This paper introduces an efficient and accurate cryptography-based scheme for mining the cloud data in a secure way without loss of accuracy. Specifically, we address the problem of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification over horizontally distributed databases without revealing any unnecessary information. We have utilized the recently developed cryptography primitive, order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE), to integrate securely the local classifications at a lower cost than the previously presented privacy preserving data mining schemes. Empirical results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme has similar performance with the naive mining systems in terms of classification accuracy.;;2012;"Ibrahim, Ayad; Jin, Hai; Yassin, Ali A. & Zou, Deqing";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6382808 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2416637.2416805;IEEE;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1060;Distributed data-parallel computing using a high-level programming language;;;2009;Isard, Michael & Yu, Yuan;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1559845.1559962 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.187.8418;ACM Press;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1061;Mapping abstract queries to big data web resources for on-the-fly data integration and information retrieval;The emergence of technologies such as XML, web services and cloud computing have helped, the proliferation of databases and their diversity pose serious barriers to meaningful information extraction from these “big databases”. Research in intention recognition has also progressed substantially, yet very little has been done to recognize query intents to search, select, map and extract responses from such enormous pools of candidate databases. Query mapping becomes truly complicated particularly in scientific databases where tools and functions are needed to interpret the database contents, semantics of which are usually hidden inside the functions. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called BioVis, using which biologists potentially are able to express their “intentional queries” with the expectation that a mapping function $\mu$ is able to accurately understand the meaning of the queries and map them to the underlying resources appropriately. We show that such a function is technically feasible if we can design a schema mapping function that can tailor itself according to a knowledgebase and recognize entities in schema graphs.

This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on China’s special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised application model that correlates project engineering data and project management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction project.

ASP is a software service model in which the service is provided on a one by one basis according its ownership, while SaaS is a software service model in which the service is provided virtually on a one by one basis, but physically all at once. In a SaaS environment, all users can access the system via Internet without any software installation—examples include Google and Amazon. Now, more companies are shifting their business software service from ASP to SaaS. However effecting the transition of the existing software and data from ASP to SaaS is not an easy task. First, we have to solve the problem of the integration of data for different forms of software, because each data set consists of different data types. Second, the software integration must support a user customizing interface for various users on the Web. Almost all users want customized services, but those require high costs. In this paper we propose a novel method for transferring the existing business software to integrated software that can be used in the SaaS environment. We use a master table and master code to implement the integrated system. The master table is based on the project master table, and other user information tables are connected to collect the necessary information. All information about the project is stored in each column of the project master table. The master table can integrate various software databases. By using this novel methodology, the existing ASP-based software and data can be effectively transferred to the SaaS environment.;;2012;"Kim, Wonil; Lee, Joo Hwan; Hong, Chuleui; Han, Changhee; Lee, Hanku & Jang, Bongshik";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2350809.2351101 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089812211200274X;Pergamon Press, Inc.;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1067;Position paper: cloud system deployment and performance evaluation tools for distributed databases;;;2013;Klems, Markus & Anh L\^{e}, Ho\`{a}ng;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2462307.2462322;ACM Press;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1068;The VPH-Share Data Management Platform: Enabling Collaborative Data Management for the Virtual Physiological Human Community;The objective of the Virtual Physiological Human Initiative is to provide a systematic framework for understanding physiological processes in the human body in terms of anatomical structure and biophysical mechanisms across multiple length and time scales.

New information and communication technologies such as smart phones and computer-based social networks have great potential to transform the roles of citizens in emergency management. However, current digital citizen science projects are usually limited in three areas: 1) limited one-way citizen participation, 2) no processing and integration of citizens' reports with other existing infrastructure sensing data, 3) no personalized near-real-time spatiotemporal visualization tools for citizens to instantly view aggregated data to gain updated situational awareness. We developed a Mapster application that specifically addresses these issues. First, we leveraged Twitter's geo-referenced tweets functionality to design a customized smart phone application for citizens to report a set of events that have been identified in past urban flooding situations such as ""basement flooding"" and ""powerline down"" etc. Second, a Cloud-based semantic streaming data harvesting and processing tool was developed to fetch and process both the Twitter feeds and other infrastructure sensing data such as US National Weather Service's radar data. Third, a user can instantly explore the heterogeneous data processed and provided by the Cloud service through a map-based spatiotemporal animation tool on the smart phone to see how all the events evolve before, during, and after a storm.

RDF Molecules appear to offer an ideal approach - providing an intermediate level of granularity between RDF graphs and triples. However, the original RDF molecule definition has inherent limitations that will adversely affect performance.

In recent years, a growing number of companies have adopted various types of non-relational databases, commonly referred to as NoSQL databases, and as the applications they serve emerge, they gain extensive market interest. These new database systems are not relational by definition and therefore they do not support full SQL functionality. Moreover, as opposed to relational databases they trade consistency and security for performance and scalability. As increasingly sensitive data is being stored in NoSQL databases, security issues become growing concerns.

Because the SI model can lead to non-serializable transaction executions, we investigate two conflict detection techniques for ensuring serializability. To support scalability, we investigate system architectures and mechanisms in which the transaction management functions are decoupled from the storage system and integrated with the application-level processes. We present two system architectures and demonstrate their scalability under the scale-out model of cloud computing platforms. In the first system architecture all transaction management functions are executed in a fully decentralized manner by the application processes. The second architecture is based on a hybrid approach in which the conflict detection functions are performed by a dedicated service.

The RBAC mechanism forms an enhanced security framework for Grids and Clouds that will allow for interoperability between technologies in the two domains. The mechanisms being proposed here are important because the current lack of software tools and security standards in accessing distributed HPC systems and transporting Large Data Sets can add immensely to overheads in data processing or data integration times. RBAC models make policy management scalable and by virtue of being modular allow for more sophisticated access control models to be integrated with them. This paper shows how existing security standards can be leveraged for the specification and management of RBAC policies with the aim to allow disparate applications, systems and security domains to interoperate. The extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) can be used for policy specification and management across disparate organizations and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used for authentication and authorization assertions across the same. Both standards can be leveraged to facilitate policy management and enforcement, and delegation of rights.

The first method is suitable for sparse vegetation and is founded on the application of the well-known water cloud model. As for dense vegetation canopy, we have designed a model that expresses the variation of the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil characteristics as a function of the variations of the measured backscattering coefficient and of the biomass, assuming the availability of a time series of radar and optical data. To carry out the soil moisture retrieval, a multi-temporal inversion algorithm, based on the Bayesian MAP criterion, has been developed. It integrates all the samples of the time series of SAR data corrected for the vegetation effects. The approaches were evaluated on two case studies; the first one concerning an ENVISAT/ASAR observation of an agricultural site located in Northern Italy.

Various approaches have been used to include in models information from sources at different scales combining multi-resolution products in order to integrate the spatio-temporal variability of sub-pixel pattern. A methodology is proposed for the integration of the results obtained with a geostatistical downscaling algorithm, based on block-to-point-kriging, in a General Additive Models interpolation framework to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of remote sensing data. This allows a good reproduction of the overall spatial pattern of the target images and of their local values. The developed framework was tested using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) with the thermal band of Landsat in a situation of high contamination of clouds for the high resolution dataset. The method proved to be flexible and able to blend data from different sensors maintaining the finer spatial structure of the higher resolution data. The method combines strengths from different approaches: (1) it uses of information held in covariates to provide more accurate results; (2) it is applicable to a variety of remote sensing products as the method does not rely on predetermined functional relationships; (3) it can cope with cloud-rich high resolution images as only a subset of high resolution pixels is needed. This approach is general and can be used with numerous combinations of high and low resolution images, such as MODIS-derived variables, using related band ratios from Landsat or other higher resolution sensors.

Therefore, they face the challenge of being not able to have an integrated view for their related data objects (e.g. mails, pics, docs, contacts). Recently, most of the major Internet services provide standard APIs that allow developing software applications that can read and write data from their underlying data store after providing the credential access information of registered accounts. The MyDeepWeb system is designed to let the Web users interact with their Internet services normally while, behind the scene, the information of their objects will be extracted, consolidated, linked and then populated into a single private cloud-based data store where the user can have integrated access to their data objects from anywhere through multiple devices.;;2011;Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna;http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2061042.2061977 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6009338;IEEE;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1112;Active XML-based Web data integration;;;2013;"Salem, Rashed; Boussa\""{\i}d, Omar & Darmont, J\'{e}r\^{o}me";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2507403.2507453;Kluwer Academic Publishers;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1113;Application of Hadoop MapReduce technique to Virtual Database system design;Today in the world of cloud and grid computing integration of data from heterogeneous databases is inevitable. Virtual Database Technology (VDB) is one of the effective solutions for integration of data from heterogeneous sources. This will become complex when size of the database is very large. MapReduce is a new framework specifically designed for processing huge datasets on distributed sources. Apache's Hadoop is an implementation of MapReduce. Currently Hadoop has been applied successfully for file based datasets. This paper proposes to utilize the parallel and distributed processing capability of Hadoop MapReduce for handling heterogeneous query execution on large datasets.

Overview of the recent manufacturing enterprises shows that successful global manufacturing enterprises have distributed their manufacturing capabilities over the globe. The successes of global manufacturing enterprises depend upon the entire worldwide integration of their product development processes and manufacturing operations that are distributed over the globe. Distributed manufacturing agents' collaboration and manufacturing data integrity play a major role in global manufacturing enterprises' success. There are number of works, conducted to enable the distributed manufacturing agents to collaborate with each other. To achieve the manufacturing data integrity through manufacturing processes, numbers of solutions have been proposed which one of the successful solutions is to use ISO 10303 (STEP) standard. However, adopting this standard one can recognize antonym effects of integration and collaboration approaches that weaken both integration and collaboration capabilities of manufacturing agents. In our latest work, we had developed an integrated and collaborative manufacturing platform named LAYMOD. Albeit the platform in question was through enough to be applied in various collaborative and integrated CAx systems, its embedded structure hampers its application for collaboration in distributed manufacturing systems. To achieve an integrated and collaborative platform for distributed manufacturing agents, this paper proposes a service-oriented approach. This approach is originated from cloud computing paradigm known as one of the technologies which enables a major transformation in manufacturing industry. Also, to maintain the product data integration based on the STEP standard, a new service-oriented approach is proposed. This approach is in parallel to the new capability of the STEP standard for supporting XML data structures. The result is a new platform named XMLAYMOD. XMLAYMOD is able to support distributed manufacturing collaboration and data integration based on the STEP standard.

Supposing the data stored in the storage devices is of high duplication and similarity, the system administrator cannot guarantee that every node (peer) in the cloud computing system can maintain the best status for data integration. Moreover, when the number of nodes keeps increasing, the number of files will be multiplied, which results to not only the system administrator's heavy workload, but also the waste of hardware resources. Finally, the flexibility and quickness of cloud storage system is gone, and what left is a lot of duplicate and redundant data. Therefore, in order to avoid the system burden caused by duplicate data, we propose novel data center management architecture: Index Name Server (INS), which integrates de-duplication and access point selection optimization techniques to enhance the performance of the cloud storage system. With the attempt to attain load balancing, we use several specific INS parameters to dynamically monitor the parameters, like IP information and busy level index, to avoid the network congestion or the long waiting time during data transmission.;;2012;"Wu, Tin-Yu; Lee, Wei-Tsong; Lin, Yu-San; Lin, Yih-Sin; Chan, Hung-Lin & Huang, Jhih-Siang";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6154011;IEEE;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1140;On the performance projectability of MapReduce;;;2012;"Xie, Di; Hu, Y.

At the same time, reduction of cost is also considered as an important advantage of cloud computing. Data integration can notably benefit from cloud computing because integrating data is usually an expensive task. However, existing optimization techniques pay less attention on the fact that different execution plans of the same data integration application generate different usage costs while cloud computing provides good enough performance, so this paper introduces the cost optimization of cloud-based data integration system. The data integration system's data service layer facilitates accessing and composing information from a range of enterprise data sources through data service composition. In addition, two task scheduling algorithms for parallel part and non-parallel part are proposed to minimize the usage cost required to complete the execution of composite data service when computational capability provided by cloud computing is charged. Both of the two can obtain optimal plans in polynomial time. Experiments with the system indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant cost saving over more straightforward techniques.;;2012;"Zhang, Peng; Han, Yanbo; Zhao, Zhuofeng & Wang, Guiling";http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420242.2420527 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6385207;IEEE;DI and Cloud;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1150;Fault tolerance study for durable storage on the cloud;Durability indicates a system's ability to preserve committed data in the long term.

These strategies were all developed for specific platforms and application types and have been tailored to the characteristics of the underlying system architectures and application requirements. Cloud systems differ from these previous frameworks in that they are designed to support large numbers of customer-oriented applications, each with different quality of service (QoS) requirements and resource consumption characteristics. Moreover, most cloud architectures are deployed over large-scale geographically distributed infrastructures, raising challenges on data durability as well as system efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we investigated different approaches to the design of durable data cloud platforms. In particular, we consider prevailing cloud platforms and cloud-based applications and examine the impacts of different redundancy and repair strategies to enhance the durability of the data in the cloud.

Anonymizing data sets via generalization to satisfy certain privacy requirements such as k-anonymity is a widely used category of privacy preserving techniques. At present, the scale of data in many cloud applications increases tremendously in accordance with the Big Data trend, thereby making it a challenge for commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process such large-scale data within a tolerable elapsed time. As a result, it is a challenge for existing anonymization approaches to achieve privacy preservation on privacy-sensitive large-scale data sets due to their insufficiency of scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable two-phase top-down specialization (TDS) approach to anonymize large-scale data sets using the MapReduce framework on cloud. In both phases of our approach, we deliberately design a group of innovative MapReduce jobs to concretely accomplish the specialization computation in a highly scalable way.

However, for security reasons enterprises often need to store the core proprietary data in their own relational databases, while common data to be widely available can be stored in a cloud data repository. For example, the subsidiaries of a global enterprise are located in different geographic places where each subsidiary is likely to maintain its own local database. In such a scenario, data integration among the local databases and the cloud-based data is inevitable. We have developed a system called BigIntegrator to enable general queries that combine data in cloud-based data stores with relational databases. We present the design and working principle of the system. A scenario of querying data from both kinds of data sources is used as illustration. The system is general and extensible to integrate data from different kinds of data sources. A particular challenge being addressed is the limited query capabilities of cloud data stores.

for DiffServ over IP and MPLS reliable homogeneous multicast networks;Multicasting has become increasingly important with the emergence of Internet-based applications such as IP telephony, audio/video conferencing, distributed databases and software upgrading. IP multicasting is an efficient way to distribute information from a single source to multiple destinations at different locations. In practice IP is considered as a layer 3 protocol. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) replaces the IP forwarding by a simple label lookup. MPLS combines the flexibility of layer 3 routing and layer 2 switching. In order to provide QoS in group communications for real time applications such as video conferencing, reliable multicasting is used. Miscellaneous efforts have been undertaken to provide reliability on top of IP multicast. Two error control strategies have been popular in practice. These are the FEC (Forward Error Correction) strategy, which uses error correction alone, and the ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) strategy, which uses error detection, combined with retransmission of data. In this paper, we present a new fair share policy (FSP) that utilizes Differentiated Services to solve the problems of QoS and congestion control when reliable ARQ multicast is used. The results should provide insight into the comparisons of the residual packet loss probability between IP multicast in MPLS networks using FSP and plain IP multicasting using the same policy when DiffServ are adopted and when reliable ARQ multicast is considered.;;2004;"AlWehaibi, Abdullah; Kadoch, Michael; Agarwal, Anjali & ElHakeem, Ahmed";http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019004000201 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989519.989523;Elsevier North-Holland, Inc.;DI and QoS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1289;An optimized strategy for replication in Peer-to-Peer Distributed databases;Availability of data in Distributed databases improves the QoS factors like, fault tolerance and response time. An efficient Replication management results in high degree of availability. The Replication of data among sites increases the success possibilities during the recovery. Replication is one part of the well known issue called Data Allocation Problem along with Allocation in the design phase of Distributed Databases. The Allocation improves accessibility of data. The Data Allocation Problem is a NP-Hard in its nature. Hence it requires an optimized solution for improved results. As a result of the current trends in research towards a better Allocation and Replication strategy with the usage of Optimization techniques, this paper proposes a methodology for replication of fragments in Peer-to-Peer environment with Hungarian Assignment Algorithm of optimization technique.

In the multimedia networking field it is typical to identify the minimal QoS requirements of an application to save resources by guaranteeing its functionality. Many of these applications can operate in spite of an imperfect delivery of media data, while other applications such as distributed databases or distributed file systems consider perfect QoS necessary but accept delay. The basic problems of the latter is the consistency of their data, while the former require a consistent perception of the content. More generically, both QoS requirements can be interpreted as a problem of maintaining a consistent system state. Consequently we assume that many distributed applications, including most distributed multimedia applications, can fulfil their tasks in spite of imperfect consistency. Since the application requirements differ widely, the elements that make up “consistency” must be separated and classified. This paper introduces Consistency QoS and proposes a classification of elements that determine an application's consistency requirements. The low level QoS requirements that these separate parameters rely on are shown, and example parameter sets for application classes are given;;2001;"Griwodz, Carsten; Liepert, Michael; Saddik, Abdulmotaleb El; On, Giwon; Zink, Michael; Steinmetz, Ralf & El Saddik, A.";http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=933986 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=872017.872211;IEEE Comput.

In this paper, we propose and analyze a priority based resource sharing scheme for voice/data integrated cellular networks. The unique features of the proposed scheme are that 1) the maximum resource utilization can be achieved, since all the leftover capacity after serving the high priority voice traffic can be utilized by the data traffic; 2) a Markovian model for the proposed scheme is established, which takes account of the complex interaction of voice and data traffic sharing the total resources; 3) optimal CAC parameters for both voice and data calls are determined, from the perspective of minimizing resource requirement and maximizing new call admission rate, respectively; 4) load adaption and bandwidth allocation adjustment policies are proposed for adaptive CAC to cope with traffic load variations in a wireless mobile environment. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed CAC scheme is able to simultaneously provide satisfactory QoS to both voice and data users and maintain a relatively high resource utilization in a dynamic traffic load environment. The recent measurement-based modeling shows that the Internet data file size follows a lognormal distribution, instead of the exponential distribution used in our analysis. We use computer simulations to demonstrate that the impact of the lognormal distribution can be compensated for by conservatively applying the Markovian analysis results.

To improve the efficiency of transaction processing in mobile computers, lazy replication is used extensively.

The shortcomings make it difficult for lazy replication to be adaptive to the dynamic changes of network connection and configuration in mobile environments. In the paper, we propose a probability-based approach, which guarantees serializability and consistency.

Integration of these systems to create a unified query plan that is executed across DSMS/sensor boundaries is not a trivial task because of the different architectures and assumptions of these systems. This chapter presents an integrated query processing environment where users can seamlessly query both a data stream management system and a sensor network with one query expression. By integrating the two query processing systems, the optimization goals of the sensor network (primarily power) and server network (primarily latency and quality) can be unified into one quality of service metric. The chapter shows various steps of the unified optimization process for a sample query where the effects of each step that the optimizer takes can be directly viewed using a quality of service monitor.

The general objective is to manage a self-adapting distributed database so as to reliably and consistently provide near optimal performance as perceived by client applications. Such a management system must ultimately be capable of operating over a range of time varying usage profiles and fault scenarios, incorporate considerations for multiple updates and maintenance operations, and be capable of being scaled in a practical fashion to ever larger sized networks and databases. This paper investigates evolutionary computation techniques, comparing a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and hillclimbing on a test problem in this field. Major differential algorithm performance is found across two different fitness criteria. Preliminary conclusions are that a genetic algorithm approach seems superior to hillclimbing or annealing when the more realistic (from a quality of service viewpoint) objective function is in force.

Integrating data management across NOAA represents a significant change in NOAA business practices that will require evolution of the management structures and approaches used in NOAA for data management. Historically, archive and dissemination activities have been implemented in dedicated ""stovepipe"" systems, each focusing on the needs of a particular data collection and its associated user community. Exponential data volume growth, increasing data diversity, user requirements for common and consistent access methods across data types, and the need for economic efficiency are driving a consolidation of the information technology (IT) systems that support NOAA archives. The Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a result of this consolidation; CLASS is the enterprise IT solution in support of NOAA archives. Against this backdrop, the meaning of ""archive"" is itself changing as the challenges of long-term digital preservation are better understood. It is no longer sufficient to simply preserve ""bits."" Instead, information content is the target of preservation, with ""bits"" simply providing a medium for representing information. The ISO standard ""Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System"" (OAIS-RM) provides a conceptual framework that describes the responsibilities and activities of organizations attempting to preserve digital information. Applying the OAIS-RM to NOAA's archive efforts provides the means to identify high-level archive responsibilities, delegate roles to various NOAA organizational components, and describe the means by which these entities work together to fulfill archive requirements. At the highest level, NOAA archives maintain and apply information- and user-specific knowledge while CLASS provides IT capabilities in support o- f archive activities. Together, the archives and CLASS provide the necessary ingredients to fulfill NOAA's archive mission. Currently, CLASS holds POES, DMSP, GOES, and MetOp data. Planned future campaigns include NPP, NPOESS, EOS MODIS, NEXRAD, and model and in-situ data. To ensure the preservation of these data, CLASS has implemented a multiple site distributed system that replicates data and metadata holdings automatically. Additionally, CLASS supports the deployment of ""points of presence"" that allow the co-location of key CLASS capabilities with high-volume or otherwise critical data producers or consumers to mitigate economic constraints or meet quality-of-service requirements. Among the key challenges facing CLASS are: massive increases in data volumes, the extraordinary diversity of NOAA data, evolving user needs and requirements, and the ever-changing technology environment. CLASS must address all of these challenges - and more - at the same time it ensures the safeguarding and availability of its current holdings. CLASS is evolving toward a service-oriented architecture that provides the flexibility, scalability, and generality necessary to accommodate the vast amount of change in its environment and at the same time provide interoperability with other systems and systems of systems necessary to support NOAA's position in the environmental data arena. Adoption of standards is critical to NOAA's success, and CLASS is working with NOAA's Global Earth Observation Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) project to identify standards that will ensure CLASS'S interoperability with other NOAA systems. The lack of broad, uniform utilization of IT standards that adequately meet NOAA's data integration needs is arguably the most acute factor contributing to the weakness of data integration today. GEO-IDE will ultimately ensure that key NOAA systems, including CLASS, are interoperable within NOAA, with US-Global Earth Observation System (US-GEO), and ultimately w";;2007;Rank, Robert;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4423732;IEEE;DI and QoS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1327;Dynamic Key-Scheduling and Authentication Scheme for Distributed Wireless Network;A self-protection technique is suggested for ad hoc networks, as they fall short of the objective of data privacy, data integrity, and authentication.

Considering the huge and widely distributed amounts of data, e-science communities investigate different technologies to provide fast access to the growing data sets. Among these technologies, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Data Grid are two models that fit these requirements well, because of their potential to provide a high quality of service with low cost. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the P2P paradigm for data-intensive e-science applications on the Grid. We argue that additional support is required to achieve fast access to the huge and widely distributed amounts of data and propose eSciGrid to overcome the scalability barriers in today’s e-science communities. eSciGrid allows e-science communities to achieve a high query throughput through a decentralized protocol which integrates caching with query processing. The protocol takes into account the physical distance between peers and the amount of traffic carried by each node. The result of this integration is constant complexity for moderate queries and fast data transfers between Grid peers.

However, most of these results apply to on-line systems and relatively very little of this work is related to hard-real-time environments whereby specified bounds on processing delays are stringent and ranging from few millisecunds to few hundreds of millisecunds. Based on the ISO OSI-Reference Model analysis, rationale are presented for a reliable connectionless-mode, message due-date-dependant qualities of services and flexible conversation protocols above the transport layer. So as to support time-dependant transmission protocols, it is shown that the IEEE 802 Local Area Network standards must be enhanced in order to provide message transmission scheduling based on message due-dates. A task priority is defined as a function of both its static priority and its due-date. Data access serialization induces precedence constraints on task scheduling.

Technology has gained momentum. Industry, international organizations, and businesses, have started relying on networks to provide reliable, supportive, fast, and easy methods to maintain transactions between their branches. Issues such as bandwidth, scalability, and efficiency became pertinent parameters that had to be configured at all costs. Also, information needs to be sent from one site to several sites. All of this is happening on packet switched networks. With the introduction of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), the speed and quality of service of networks have increased tremendously. Still, the necessity of sending one information to several sites instantaneously has been unresolved. This research paper broadens this perspective, and introduces a new architecture for the future that will enable multicast routers to route packets. This paper also reviews the current state of multicast protocols, highlights the missing features, motivates the design, and develops the enhanced multicast protocols.

Moreover, the end users have started expecting very fast response times and high quality of service. Since the transfer of large MDOs across the communication network contributes to the response time observed by the end users, the problem of allocating these MDOs so as to minimize the response time becomes very challenging. This problem becomes more complex in the context of hypermedia documents (web pages), wherein the MDOs need to be synchronized during presentation to the end users. Note that the basic problem of data allocation in distributed database environments is NP-complete. Therefore, there is a need to pursue and evaluate solutions based on heuristics which generate near-optimal MDO allocation. In this paper, we address this problem by: 1) conceptualizing this problem by using a navigational model to represent hypermedia documents and their access behavior from end users, and by capturing the synchronization requirements on MDOs, 2) formulating the problem by developing a base case cost model for response time, and generalizing it to incorporate user interaction and buffer memory constraints, 3) designing two algorithms to find near-optimal solutions for allocating MDOs of the hypermedia documents while adhering to the synchronization requirements, and 4) evaluating the trade-off between the time complexity to get the solution and the quality of solution by comparing the solutions generated by the algorithms with the optimal solutions generated through an exhaustive search.

The system model consists of a base station (BS) and mobile terminals (MT), each of which is able to receive voice and/or data packets. Packets of accepted voice calls are transmitted immediately while accepted multipacket data messages are initially buffered in first in, first out (FIFO) queues created separately for each destination. The BS distinguishes between silence and talkspurt periods of voice sources, so that packets of accepted data messages can use their own codes for transmission during silent time slots. To fulfill QoS requirements for both traffic types, the number of simultaneous packet transmissions over the downlink channel must be limited. To perform this task, a fair, single-priority multiqueueing scheduling scheme is employed. Discrete-time Markov processes are used to model the system operation. Statistical dependence between queues is the main difficulty which arises during the analysis. This dependence leads to serious computational complexity. The aim of this paper is to present an approximate analytical method which enables one to evaluate system performance despite the dependence. Therefore, it is assumed that the system is heavily loaded with data traffic, and a heuristic assumption is made that makes the queueing analysis computationally tractable. Typical system performance measures (i.e., the data message blocking probability, the average data throughput and delay) are evaluated, however, due to the accepted heuristic assumption, the analysis is approximate and that is why computer simulation is used to validate it.;excluded;2005;Swiderski, J.;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1413215 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2215915.2216493;IEEE Press;DI and QoS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1337;Topic 5 parallel and distributed databases, data mining and knowledge discovery;"To manage the very large amount of data available today, computer scientists are working on efficient systems, algorithms and applications that can handle and analyze very large databases. Intensive data consuming applications are running on very large databases (on data warehouses, on multimedia databases) with the task to extract information diamonds. Data mining is one of the key applications here. However, these intensive data consuming applications suffer from performance problems and single database sources. Introducing data distribution and parallel processing help to overcome resource bottlenecks and to achieve guaranteed throughput, quality of service, and system scalability. Distributed architectures, cluster systems and P2P systems, supported by high performance networks and intelligent middleware offer parallel and distributed databases a great opportunity to support cost-effective everyday applications.Data processing and knowledge discovery on large data sources can benefit from parallel and distributed computing both to improve performance and quality of results. Development of data mining tools on high-performance parallel computers allows for analyzing massive databases in a reasonable time. Faster processing also means that users can experiment with more models to understand complex data. Furthermore, high performance makes it practical for users to analyze greater quantities of data. Distribution of data sources and data mining tasks is another key issue that the increasing decentralization of human activities and large availability of connection facilities are making more and more critical.This year, 9 papers discussing some the those issues were submitted to this topic.

Network devices alone show several applications. They need to determine a longest matching prefix for packet routing or establishment of virtual circuits. In integrated services packet networks, packets need to be classified by trying to find the most specific match from a large number of patterns, each possibly containing wildcards at arbitrary positions. Other areas of applications include such diverse areas as geographical information systems (GIS) and persistent databases. We describe a class of best matching algorithms based on slicing perpendicular to the patterns and performing a modified binary search over these slices. We also analyze their complexity and performance. We then introduce schemes that allow the algorithm to ``learn'' the structure of the database and adapt itself to it. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently implement our algorithm both using general-purpose hardware and using software running on popular personal computers and workstations. The research presented herein was originally driven by current demands in the Internet. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, the number of users, hosts, domains, and networks connected to the Internet seems to be exploding. Not surprisingly, network traffic at major exchange points is doubling every few months. The Internet is a packet network, where each data packet is passed from a router to the next in the chain, until it reaches destination. For versatility and efficient utilization of the available transmission bandwidth, each router performs its decision where to forward a packet as independent of the other routers and the other packets for the same destination as possible. Five key factors are required to keep pace if the Internet is to continue to provide good service: (1) higher link speeds, (2) better router data throughput, (3) faster packet forwarding rates, (4) quick adaptation to topology and load changes, and (5) the support for Quality-of-Service (QoS). Solutions for the first two are readily available: fiber-optic cables using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and switching backplane interconnects. We present longest matching prefix techniques which help solving the other three factors. They allow for a high rate of forwarding decisions, quick updates, and can be extended to classify packets based on multiple fields. The best known longest matching prefix solutions require memory accesses proportional to the length of the addresses. Our new algorithm uses binary search on hash tables organized by prefix lengths and scales very well as address and routing table sizes increase: independent of the table size, it requires a worst case time of log2(address bits) hash lookups. Thus only 5 hash lookups are needed for the current Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) with 32 address bits and 7 for the upcoming IPv6 with 128 address bits. We also introduce mutating binary search and other optimizations that, operating on the largest available databases, reduce the worst case to 4 hashes and allow the majority of addresses to be found with at most 2 hashes. We expect similar improvements to hold for IPv6. We extend these results to find the best match for a tuple of multiple fields of the packet's header, as required for QoS support. We also show the versatility of the resulting algorithms by using it for such diverse applications as geographical information systems, memory management, garbage collection, persistent object-oriented databases, keeping distributed databases synchronized, and performing web-server access control.;excluded;2002;"Waldvogel, Marcel; Plattner, B.; Dr, Prof; Varghese, G. & Breuer, In Memoriam Ulrich";http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.339;;DI and QoS;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1345;Voice/Data Integration in Wireless Communication Networks;Currently the integration of voice and data in mobile communication networks is still in its infancy.
