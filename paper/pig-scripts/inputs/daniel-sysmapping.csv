,Design of Power Efficient Schema for Energy Optimization in Data Center With Massive Task Execution Using DVFS,"The proposed system highlights a novel energy efficient technique by considering an entire datacenter using DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling). Unwanted power consumption was always a matter of concern from last 2 years for the administrators of datacenters. Therefore, a research trial in order to minimize the power consumption has become of the prominent concern in the area of cloud computing as it claims zero down-time as per Service Level Agreement. In this research work, we consider the case of multimedia video sharing web services, which we believe is frequently in top of the hit counter with millions of user sharing high size of video application, giving rise of power consumption from data center. The proposed system presents a unique provisioning technique which amalgamates the power factor with network resources. The simulation results also show that the system is successful in maintaining an equilibrium between power utilization at data center along with unit of task allocation processing.

,PAY-PER-USE REVENUE MODELS FOR GEOPROCESSING SERVICES IN THE CLOUD,"Cloud Computing is one of the latest trends in the mainstream IT world and hints at a future in which the storage of data and the hosting of applications are no longer performed on local computers, but on distributed third-party facilities. From a provider perspective, Cloud Computing enables companies to significantly increase their hardware utilization rate and allows external customers to use the company's infrastructure on pay-per-use revenue models. From a client perspective, it enables the on-demand allocation of sufficient resources to solve complex computational problems or to scale all kinds of applications. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been under constant change in recent years. Emerging web service technologies stimulated the evolution from desktop- and data-centric GIS to distributed and loosely coupled web services merged into the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) concept. The processing of data is an essential part of daily work of GIS experts. With increasing amount of 
available data and higher requirements on adopted algorithms, the data processing part in SDIs becomes crucial in terms of practicability and performance. Cloud Computing offers a technical opportunity for the on-demand provisioning of sufficient resources for computing-intensive algorithms and an economic opportunity to support future business models. This paper presents an OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) implementation that uses Cloud Computing resources to perform geoprocessing tasks. The resource usage is monitored and the accumulated usage costs are charged to the service consumer account. The implementation will be demonstrated in a real world use case that is based on governmental forest management.",,,"A, B. Baranski; A, T. Deelmann & B, B.

,Study of Knowledge Based Admission Control for a Software-as-a-Service Provider in Cloud Computing Environments,"Software as a Service (SaaS) provides access to applications to end users over the Internet without upfront investment in infrastructure and software. To serve their customers, SaaS providers utilize resources of internal data centers or rent resources from a public Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. In-house hosting can increase administration and maintenance costs whereas renting from an IaaS provider can impact the service quality due to its variable performance. To overcome these limitations, innovative admission control and scheduling algorithms for SaaS providers to effectively utilize public Cloud resources to maximize profit by minimizing cost and improving customer satisfaction level are required. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive evaluation study to analyze which solution suits best in which scenario to maximize SaaS provider’s profit.",,2013,"A, R. S. Mohana; B, Dr. P. Thangaraj & C, S.

,Dynamic hosting management of Web based applications over clouds,"Dynamic Application Hosting Management (DAHM) allows clouds to dynamically host applications in data centers at different locations based on: (i) spatio-temporal variation of energy price, (ii) data center computing and cooling energy efficiency, (iii) Virtual Machine (VM) migration cost for the applications, and (iv) any SLA violations due to migration overhead or network delay. DAHM is complementary to dynamic workload distribution problem and is modeled as mixed integer programming; online algorithms are developed to solve the problem. The algorithms are evaluated in a simulation study using realistic data and compared with performance-oriented application assignment, i.e., hosting the application at a data center whose delay is the least. Our simulations results indicate that DAHM can potentially save up to 20\% cost while incurring only a nominal increase in SLA violations. The savings are obtained by exploiting the cost efficiency variation as well as reducing the total number of VMs employed to host applications.",,2011,"Abbasi, Zahra; Mukherjee, Tridib; Varsamopoulos, Georgios; Gupta, Sandeep K.

,Towards Energy Efficient Change Management in a Cloud Computing Environment,"The continuously increasing cost of managing IT systems has led many companies to outsource their commercial services to external hosting centers. Cloud computing has emerged as one of the enabling technologies that allow such external hosting efficiently. Like any IT environment, a Cloud Computing environment requires high level of maintenance to be able to provide services to its customers. Replacing defective items (hardware/software), applying security patches, or upgrading firmware are just a few examples of the typical maintenance procedures needed in such environments. While taking resources down for maintenance, applying efficient change management techniques is a key factor to the success of the cloud. As energy has become a precious resource, research has been conducted towards devising protocols that minimize energy consumption in IT systems. In this paper, we propose a pro-active energy efficient technique for change management in cloud computing environments. We formulate the management problem into an optimization problem that aims at minimizing the total energy consumption of the cloud. Our proposed approach is pro-active in the sense that it takes prior SLA (Service Level Agreement) requests into account while determining time slots in which changes should take place.",,2009,"Abdelsalam, Hady; Maly, Kurt; Mukkamala, Ravi; Zubair, Mohammad & Kaminsky, David",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1574663.1574681,Springer Berlin Heidelberg,SLA and Cloud
,Analysis of Energy Efficiency in Clouds,"A cloud can be defined as a pool of computer resources that can host a variety of different workloads, ranging from long-running scientific jobs (e.g., modeling and simulation) to transactional work (e.g., web applications). A cloud computing platform dynamically provisions, configures, reconfigures, and de-provisions servers as needed. Servers in the cloud can be physical machines or virtual machines. Cloud-hosting facilities, including many large businesses that run clouds in-house, became more common as businesses tend to out-source their computing needs more and more. For large-scale clouds power consumption is a major cost factor. Modern computing devices have the ability to run at various frequencies each one with a different power consumption level. Hence, the possibility exists to choose frequencies at which applications run to optimize total power consumption while staying within the constraints of the Service Level Agreements (SLA) that govern the applications. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical relationship of these SLAs and the number of servers that should be used and at what frequencies they should be running. We discuss a proactive provisioning model that includes hardware failures, devices available for services, and devices available for change management, all as a function of time and within constraints of SLAs. We provide scenarios that illustrate the mathematical relationships for a sample cloud and that provides a range of possible power consumption savings for different environments.",,2009,"Abdelsalam, Hady S.; Maly, Kurt; Mukkamala, Ravi; Zubair, Mohammad & Kaminsky, David",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1673078.1674366 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5359623,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Towards integrating information of service level agreement and resources as a services (RaaS) for cloud computing environment,"Cloud computing describes services and applications that are extended to be accessible through the Internet. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contractual agreement that has been established between the members of Cloud Service Provider (CSP) that consists of the service provider and its recipient for a specific application of services based on its allocating and sharing Resources as a Service (RaaS). In this context, there are many parties who are very concerning about it, but unfortunately there is lack of a common mapping of SLA information and RaaS of best practice as a guideline that can be used by CSP in making decision for the future purposes in engaging with services in the cloud computing environment. Therefore, the main goal of this paper is to integrate information of SLA and RaaS in order to ensure everybody who are providing and receiving the services in the cloud particularly will be satisfied and getting the best maximum Return Of the Investment (ROI) in allocating and sharing resources among the providers and recipients in cloud computing environment. As a result, some attributes such as reliability, readability and standardization of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are found to be high.",,2012,"Abdullah, Rusli & Talib, Amir Mohamed",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6417613,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Bidding Strategies in QoS-Aware Cloud Systems Based on N-Armed Bandit Problems,"In this paper we consider a set of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers, that offer a set of Web services using the Cloud facilities provided by an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. We assume that the IaaS provider offers a pay only what you use scheme similar to the Amazon EC2 service, comprising flat, on demand, and spot virtual machine instances. We propose a two-stage provisioning scheme. In the first stage, the SaaS providers determine the number of required flat and on demand instances by means of standard optimization techniques. In the second stage, the SaaS providers compete by bidding for the spot instances which are instantiated using the unused IaaS capacity. We put our focus on the bidding decision process by the SaaS providers, which takes place during the second stage, and apply N-armed bandit problems, in which the player is faced repeatedly with a choice among N different options, and every time he submits his decision evaluating past feedbacks. Through numerical experiments, we analyze proposed strategies under different scenarios and prove the SaaS providers ability to refine their behavior round by round and to determine the best bid so to maximize their revenue and achieve as many spot resources as possible, also addressing the importance of a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, i.e., among greedy and non-greedy actions.",,2014,"Abundo, Marco; Di Valerio, Valerio; Cardellini, Valeria & Presti, Francesco Lo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6786761 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2607055.2607497,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Cloud monitoring: A survey,"Nowadays, Cloud Computing is widely used to deliver services over the Internet for both technical and economical reasons. The number of Cloud-based services has increased rapidly and strongly in the last years, and so is increased the complexity of the infrastructures behind these services. To properly operate and manage such complex infrastructures effective and efficient monitoring is constantly needed. Many works in literature have surveyed Cloud properties, features, underlying technologies (e.g. virtualization), security and privacy. However, to the best of our knowledge, these surveys lack a detailed analysis of monitoring for the Cloud. To fill this gap, in this paper we provide a survey on Cloud monitoring. We start analyzing motivations for Cloud monitoring, providing also definitions and background for the following contributions. Then, we carefully analyze and discuss the properties of a monitoring system for the Cloud, the issues arising from such properties and how such issues have been tackled in literature. We also describe current platforms, both commercial and open source, and services for Cloud monitoring, underlining how they relate with the properties and issues identified before. Finally, we identify open issues, main challenges and future directions in the field of Cloud monitoring.1Preliminary results within the same framework have been published in G. Aceto, A.

,Cloud computing architectures and dynamic provisioning mechanisms,"Cloud computing is a prodigious modern technology committed to provide pool of resources to the on-demand customers. The resources in a cloud are virtualized as a collection of services using the virtualization technology. Efficient provisioning of resources is a lofty problem due to the lively nature and the need to support heterogeneous applications with diverse performance requirements. The performance guarantee from the cloud datacenter requires efficient utilization of the resources. The efficient resource utilization towards any specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) or constraint on Quality of Service (QoS) alone is not sufficient for the cloud computing environments. Thus, cloud computing requires to strike a balance between the performance based on the negotiated QoS as well as the energy consumption at the datacenter during the process of resource provisioning. In this paper, we provide a detailed review of cloud computing architectures and provisioning mechanisms for delivering the computing as a service. We classify the cloud computing architectures discussed in literature based on their significance in cloud services provisioning mechanism. The paper presents taxonomy of dynamic provisioning mechanisms from the cloud utility point of view and brings out salient features/evaluation of existing mechanisms.",,2013,"Acharya, Shreenath & D'Mello, Demian Antony",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6823543,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,"Energy Efficient Geographical Load Balancing via
Dynamic Deferral of Workload","With the increasing popularity of Cloud computing and Mobile computing, individuals, enterprises and research centers have started outsourcing their IT and computational needs to on-demand cloud services. Recently geographical load balancing techniques have been suggested for data centers hosting cloud computation in order to reduce energy cost by exploiting the electricity price differences across regions. However, these algorithms do not draw distinction among diverse requirements for responsiveness across various workloads. In this paper, we use the flexibility from the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to differentiate among workloads under bounded latency requirements and propose a novel approach for cost savings for geographical load balancing. We investigate how much workload to be executed in each data center and how much workload to be delayed and migrated to other data centers for energy saving while meeting deadlines. We present an offline formulation for geographical load balancing problem with dynamic deferral and give online algorithms to determine the assignment of workload to the data centers and the migration of workload between data centers in order to adapt with dynamic electricity price changes. We compare our algorithms with the greedy approach and show that significant cost savings can be achieved by migration of workload and dynamic deferral with future electricity price prediction. We validate our algorithms on MapReduce traces and show that geographic load balancing with dynamic deferral can provide 20-30 % cost-savings.",,2012,"Adnan, Muhammad Abdullah; Sugihara, Ryo & Com, Usa Amazon.",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.396.2492,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An Approach to Build Multi-tenant SaaS Application with Monitoring and SLA,"SaaS (Software as a Service) is a modern approach to deliver large scalable enterprise software as a service on Internet. Cloud computing platform provides the scalability, availability and utility computing for services on Internet. There are many technical challenges involved in SaaS development. One of them is multi-tenancy, which allows single instance of software to serve multiple organizations by accommodating their unique requirements through configuration at the same time. SaaS architecture requires the both configuration and some level of customization to achieve higher maturity model. In this paper, we proposed a metadata driven SaaS architecture, which is independent of underlying cloud infrastructure. Proposed architecture includes monitoring, tenant management, tenant administration, tenant configuration and large data management services. In our proposed architecture, we used Memcached concept and it is supported by almost all databases to boost the performance. In addition to this, we have considered application pooling on web server to manage priority among tenants.",,2012,"Aghera, Piyush; Chaudhary, Sanjay & Kumar, Vikas",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2223952.2224325 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6200688,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Enhanced Proximity-Based Routing Policy for Service Brokering in Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (applications) as services, which are made available to consumers as subscription-based services under the pay-as-you-go model. CloudAnalyst is a tool that helps developers to simulate large-scale Cloud applications with the purpose of understanding performance of such applications under various deployment configurations. CloudAnalyst deploys different service brokering policies depending on the requirements of the cloud application. The proximity-based routing policy selects nearest data center without taking into account the response time. At times, the proximity-based routing policy may cause overloading of the closest data center. I propose an enhanced proximity-based routing policy that redirects a part/whole of the traffic to the next nearest datacenter in the same region and thereby, reduces overloading of the closest datacenter and avoids SLA violation.",,,"Ahmed, A.

,E-healthcare and data management services in a cloud,"E-Healthcare data management is a core issue in a modern hospital. The data generated is enormous due to newer diagnostic techniques. The medical doctors and patients demand a greater life time for medical data records, they require fast data retrieval, and presentation services for Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS). The cost on maintaining a data service centre in an average hospital may be substantial both on infrastructure and qualified ICT staff. The availability of large storage capacities and computing resources from Cloud Service Providers (CSP) is seen as an opportunity to save investment by outsourcing information services. Electronic Patient Record (EPR) management is sensitive issue which requires a foolproof security. It is extremely important to develop methods to relieve the clients from problems of security, integrity, availability and cross CSP mobility. We present E-Healthcare models for ubiquitous services for data acquisition archiving and presentation in Cloud. The management issues and security concerns in cloud domains are addressed by a services architecture proposed.

,Autonomic computing architecture for real-time medical application running on virtual private cloud infrastructures,"Cloud computing with virtualization technologies has become a huge trend which attracts academia and information technology industries because of its cost-efficiency. It has changed paradigms of development, release, and maintenance of diverse types of software and service. However, this big movement has not been applied to real-time applications yet because deploying real-time applications on the cloud infrastructures arouses many controversies because of numerous uncertainties from sharing physical resources. It is not trivial to apply conventional scheduling techniques for real-time systems to cloud infrastructures without further considerations. All virtual machines (VMs) must be controlled by the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) which is centralized and has a primary role to share physical resources fairly with all VMs in the same physical machine (PM). For best-effort applications, this fair resource sharing policy works well and end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) is promised by the service level agreement (SLA) with reasonable delay windows. However, for real-time applications with aperiodic hard- and soft-real-time tasks, this mechanism has serious weaknesses. Although VMMs of most cloud infrastructures have auto-scaling and load-balancing mechanisms, these are unpredictably slow to accept urgent aperiodic-real-time tasks because of its fair resource sharing policy. Therefore, it is necessary to propose another approach to satisfy deadline constraints of real-time tasks transferred from remote locations. In this research, we focus on cloud medical applications processing sensitive patient data with deadline constraints. We propose feasible solutions to reserve computing and networking resources with an autonomic computing architecture in the virtual private cloud infrastructures.",,2013,"Ahn, Yong Woon & Cheng, Albert Mo Kim",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2518148.2518153,ACM,SLA and Cloud
,SLA Based Scheduler for Cloud for Storage \& Computational Services,"The proposed work gives novel technique to exploit the cloud for the purpose of qualitative improvement in services being rendered. In this context a service level agreement is executed between the service provider and the user incorporating stipulations regarding terms \& conditions relevant with the transactions. Agreement envisages the provisioning of services to the users at the appointed time and charges commensurate with the market scenario. Besides the interests of the service providers are equally watched upon by allowing negotiations and settlements at par with prevailing market trends, thus ensuring benefits to both the service providers and the users. The scheduler algorithm allows re-provisioning of resources on the cloud in the event of failures. The focus of the model is to provide fair deal to the users and consumers, enhanced quality of service as well as generation of optimal revenue.",,2011,"Ahuja, Ravin; De, Asok & Gabrani, Goldie",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2014696.2014750 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5959568,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Performance Analysis of a Framework for Multi-Interfaced Service Level Agreements on Mobile Devices,"Today, the service computing research is focusing on the ubiquitous and on-the-move availability of Internet applications as cloud services. As a result, the mobility is rapidly becoming an important requirement of the future. In addition to that, the integration of mobile and service computing domains enables the existing mobile devices to offer their resources as mobile Web Services (WS). For this reason, these mobile WS are expected to become ubiquitous, as they may be offered by any connected device. Previously, we presented a concept of protecting such mobile WS by using Service Level Agreements (SLA) on mobile devices, where we explained the four primary architectural components of the SLA framework and classified their functions into four fundamental life cycles. In continuation of that, here, we present the detailed performance analysis of the SLA framework, while taking into account the SOAP and REST service access interfaces. Our processing analysis shows the percentage increase due to the SLA overhead compared to the normal unprotected mobile WS. These results are used to evaluate several parameters within the performance metric of the synchronous and asynchronous mobile WS architectures.",,2011,"Aijaz, Fahad; Shaikh, Shuja Jamil & Walke, Bernhard",,,SLA and Cloud
,A framework for multi-interfaced Service Level Agreements on mobile devices,"Today, the service computing research is focusing on providing efficient solutions to the challenges of the future Internet applications.

Furthermore, the paper explains the four primary architectural components and classifies their functions into four fundamental SLA life cycles.

,Cloud Client Prediction Models Using Machine Learning Techniques,"One way to proactively provision resources and meet Service Level Agreements (SLA) is by predicting future resource demands a few minutes ahead because of Virtual Machine (VM) boot time. In this research, we have developed and evaluated cloud client prediction models for TPC-W benchmark web application using three machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and Linear Regression (LR). We have included two SLA metrics -- Response Time and Throughput with the aim of providing the client with a more robust scaling decision choice. As an improvement to our previous work, we implemented our model on a public cloud infrastructure: Amazon EC2. Furthermore, we extended the experimentation time by over 200\%.

,Determination of optimal service level in cloud e-marketplaces based on service offering delay,"With the drift of consumers to the E-cloud marketplaces based on different service offerings, waiting time is of great importance to cloud service consumers and also the source of competitive advantage for cloud providers. Keeping customers waiting due to poor level of service leads to service degradation which in turn leads to breach of Service Level Agreement; and this may incur additional cost. We saw an opportunity to determine the optimum service level that minimizes the cost of delay in offering a service and made it our goal. Most researchers have approached this using the exogenous non-priority queue model; which would have been useful where service offerings are not differentiated. Our approach uses the Non-Preemptive queuing modeling. In this approach, the queuing theory is used to get our measure of effectiveness which is then used in our cost model to determine the optimal service level. We conclude that our results are useful where the providers need minimum cost to be incurred for better profit maximization.",,2014,"Akingbesote, A.O; Adigun, M.O; Jembere, E.; Othman, M.A. & Ajayi, I.R",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6914190,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Framework for SLA-based cloud services verification and composition,"Cloud computing is becoming a key element in service provision on the Internet. Businesses are seizing the availability of infrastructure as service to obtain cost effective infrastructure solutions. However, in businesses the power of services emerges from the ability to combine different services in order to obtain some value added services. Cloud services composition presents some challenges like, service discovery and real time service evaluation; which are addressed in this paper by introducing a primal framework that enables dynamic specification of SLAs, in addition to SLA-based verification and composition of services on the Cloud. The verification is used as input to the composition and consists of verifying the functional and non-functional properties of the cloud service under test.

,Robust Coordination of Cloud-Internal Denial of Service Attacks,"In an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud environment, workloads change dynamically with limited insight by service providers into the precise characteristics of client workloads. At the same time, service providers must seek to honour service level agreements (SLA) regarding performance and availability. In this paper we describe and analyse a class of attacks that may target other workloads or the ability of a service provider to satisfy SLA requirements by launching tightly coordinated attack or attack sequence. The attack seeks to utilise resource over-commitment and the cost of migration and related secondary effects such as power management rather than relying on implementation-specific weaknesses that could be mitigated more easily. The effectiveness of the attack depends on the ability to co-locate and precisely modulate workloads of virtual machines (VMs) on a single host. We describe a novel coordination protocol relying on broadcast primitives in memory-based covert channels for dynamic attack group membership and attack initiation based on a broadcast variant of the Jarecki-Kim-Tsudik (JKT) protocol. This protocol requires very limited channel capacity and has O(n + T) message complexity whilst tolerating up to T failures, increasing the difficulty of detection and mitigation.",,2013,"Alarifi, Suaad & Wolthusen, Stephen D.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686020 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2569433.2569948,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,GeoProof: Proofs of Geographic Location for Cloud Computing Environment,"Cloud computing has emerged as a major ICT trend and has been acknowledged as a key theme of industry by prominent ICT organisations. However, one of the major challenges that face the cloud computing concept and its global acceptance is how to secure and protect the data that is the property of the user. The geographic location of cloud data storage centres is an important issue for many organisations and individuals due to the regulations and laws that require data and operations to reside in specific geographic locations. Thus, data owners may need to ensure that their cloud providers do not compromise the SLA contract and move their data into another geographic location. This paper introduces an architecture for a new approach for geographic location assurance, which combines the proof of storage protocol (POS) and the distance-bounding protocol. This allows the client to check where their stored data is located, without relying on the word of the cloud provider. This architecture aims to achieve better security and more flexible geographic assurance within the environment of cloud computing.",,2012,"Albeshri, Aiiad; Boyd, Colin & Nieto, Juan Gonzalez",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6258199 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2355578.2357365,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Formal modeling and dynamic verification of service level agreements in cloud computing,"A Service Level Agreement (SLA) defines the contract between a cloud provider and a cloud customer, detailing the resources being provided, the price the user will pay, and the Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees that the cloud provider ensures for the customer. If the QoS guarantees are not upheld, typically the cloud provider is assessed some penalties, such as a payment credit for the customer. Monitoring and enforcing the SLA is an area of open research, and in this research we present the foundations towards a full realization of an SLA monitoring infrastructure. We proposed a formal model that can precisely describe both the SLA QoS guarantees and the penalties assessed for violation. Also, we implemented the proposed model as a dynamic SLA monitoring infrastructure system which is used for automatic SLA enforcement efficiently. Our SLA monitoring system can be deployed in any cloud environment and it can be used to monitor any type of QoS parameters. The performance and efficiency of the proposed SLA framework was measured and proved that our SLA model is efficient and reliable.",,2013,"Al-Ghuwairi, Abdel-Rahman F.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2575052,New Mexico State University,SLA and Cloud

In the last section, we discuss the advantages and limitations of current performance measurement models for SOA, distributed systems, grid computing, and cloud services. Finally, we summarize and conclude our work.",,2011,"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam & Chang, Elizabeth",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2075764.2075770,Springer-Verlag,SLA and Cloud
,Conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing,"Cloud computing has been a hot topic in the research community since 2007. In cloud computing, the online services are conducted to be pay-as-you-use. Service customers need not be in a long term contract with service providers. Service level agreements (SLAs) are agreements signed between a service provider and another party such as a service consumer, broker agent, or monitoring agent. Because cloud computing is a recent technology providing many services for critical business applications, reliable and flexible mechanisms to manage online contracts are very important. This paper presents the main criteria which should be considered at the stage of designing the SLA in cloud computing. Also, we investigate the negotiation strategies between cloud provider and cloud consumer and propose our method to maintain the trust and reliability between each of the parties involved in the negotiation process.",,2010,"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam & Chang, Elizabeth",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5610586,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SLA-Based Trust Model for Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing is a new form of technology, which infrastructure, developing platform, software, and storage can be delivered as a service in a pay as you use cost model. However, for critical business application and more sensitive information, cloud providers must be selected based on high level of trustworthiness. In this paper, we present a trust model to evaluate cloud services in order to help cloud users select the most reliable resources. We integrate our previous work “conceptual SLA framework for cloud computing” with the proposed trust management model to present a new solution of defining the reliable criteria for the selection process of cloud providers.",,2010,"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam & Chang, Elizabeth",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1915066.1915262 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5636125,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Response time for cloud computing providers,"Cloud services are becoming popular in terms of distributed technology because they allow cloud users to rent well-specified resources of computing, network, and storage infrastructure. Users pay for their use of services without needing to spend massive amounts for integration, maintenance, or management of the IT infrastructure. This creates the need for a reliable measurement methodology of the scalability for this type of new paradigm of services. In this paper, we develop performance metrics to measure and compare the scalability of the resources of virtualization on the cloud data centres. First, we discuss the need for a reliable method to compare the performance of cloud services among a number of various services being offered. Second, we develop a different type of metrics and propose a suitable methodology to measure the scalability using these types of metrics. We focus on the visualization resources such as CPU, storage disk, and network infrastructure. Finally, we compare well-known cloud providers using the proposed approach and conclude the recommendations. This type of research will help cloud consumers, before signing any official contract to use the desired services, to ascertain the ability and capacity of the cloud providers to deliver a particular service.",,2010,"Alhamad, Mohammed; Dillon, Tharam; Wu, Chen & Chang, Elizabeth",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1967486.1967579,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,Cloud monitoring for optimizing the QoS of hosted applications,"Cloud monitoring involves dynamically tracking the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters related to virtualized services (e.g., CPU, storage, network, appliances, etc.), the physical resources they share, and the applications running on them or data hosted on them. Monitoring techniques and services can help a cloud provider or application developer in regards to: (i) keeping the cloud services and hosted applications operating at peak efficiency; (ii) detecting variations in service and application performance; (iii) accounting the SLA violations of certain QoS parameters; and (iv) tracking the leave and join operations of cloud services due to failures and other dynamic configuration changes. In this paper, we describe the PhD research motivation, question, and approach and methodology related to developing novel cloud monitoring techniques and services enabling automated application QoS management under uncertainties.",,2012,"Alhamazani, Khalid; Ranjan, Rajiv; Rabhi, Fethi; Wang, Lizhe & Mitra, Karan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2469226.2469288 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6427532,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An adaptive hybrid elasticity controller for cloud infrastructures,"Cloud elasticity is the ability of the cloud infrastructure to rapidly change the amount of resources allocated to a service in order to meet the actual varying demands on the service while enforcing SLAs. In this paper, we focus on horizontal elasticity, the ability of the infrastructure to add or remove virtual machines allocated to a service deployed in the cloud. We model a cloud service using queuing theory. Using that model we build two adaptive proactive controllers that estimate the future load on a service. We explore the different possible scenarios for deploying a proactive elasticity controller coupled with a reactive elasticity controller in the cloud. Using simulation with workload traces from the FIFA world-cup web servers, we show that a hybrid controller that incorporates a reactive controller for scale up coupled with our proactive controllers for scale down decisions reduces SLA violations by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to a regression based controller or a completely reactive controller.",,2012,"Ali-Eldin, Ahmed; Tordsson, J. & Elmroth, E.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6211900,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Modelling and comparing cloud computing service level agreements,"Service-level agreements are a critical mechanism underpinning the pay-per-consumption model of business for cloud computing. Cloud providers make a variety of services of different qualities available on-demand for consumers. However, there is no standard ontology, vocabulary, or set of mechanisms that can be used for systematically and semi-automatically expressing and comparing cloud SLAs. We report on research investigating the use of MDE principles and technologies for making cloud SLAs easier to write, use and semi-automatically compare by domain experts. Our ultimate objective is to make it easier for non-experts to take decisions by programmatically comparing different cloud SLAs. We propose a metamodel for both cloud consumer requirement and cloud provider SLAs, and exploit model comparison technology for automating the comparison process.",,2012,"Alkandari, Fatima & Paige, Richard F.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2446224.2446227,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,Cost exploration of data sharings in the cloud,"Enabling data sharing among mobile apps hosted in the same cloud infrastructure can provide a competitive advantage to the mobile apps by giving them access to rich information as well as increasing the revenue for the cloud provider. We introduce a costing tool that allows application owners (i.e., consumers) and the cloud service provider to assess the cost of a desired data sharing. The costing tool enables the consumers to effectively explore the cost space by choosing between alternative configurations of varying data qualities, specified by the staleness and the accuracy of the data sharing. In other words, staleness and accuracy requirements on the data sharing are used as levers for controlling costs. These capabilities are implemented in a What-if analysis tool, which has been integrated with a large data-sharing platform. We conducted extensive experiments on the integrated platform with a sharing ecosystem created around Twitter data and show the effectiveness of the results produced by the What-if tool.",,2013,"Al-Kiswany, Samer; Hacıg\""{u}m\""{u}ş, Hakan; Liu, Ziyang & Sankaranarayanan, Jagan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2452376.2452447,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,Furthering the growth of cloud computing by providing privacy as a service,"The evolution of Cloud Computing as a viable business solution for providing hardware and software has created many security concerns. Among these security concerns, privacy is often overlooked. If Cloud Computing is to continue its growth, this privacy concern will need to be addressed. In this work we discuss the current growth of Cloud Computing and the impact the public sector and privacy can have in furthering this growth. To begin to provide privacy protection for Cloud Computing, we introduce privacy constraints that outline privacy preferences. We propose the expansion of Cloud Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to include these privacy constraints as Quality of Service (QoS) levels. This privacy QoS must be agreed upon along with the rest of the QoS terms within the SLA by the Cloud consumer and provider. Finally, we introduce Privacy as a Service (PraaS) to monitor the agreement and provide enforcement if necessary.",,2011,"Allison, David S. & Capretz, Miriam A.

,Enhanced Weighted Round Robin (EWRR) with DVFS Technology in Cloud Energy-Aware,"In recent years, the rapid evolving Cloud Computing technologies multiply challenges including minimizing power consumption and meeting Quality-of- Services (QoS) requirements in the presence of heavy workloads from a large number of users using shared computing resources. Powering a middle-sized data center normally consumed 80,000kW power every year and computer servers consume around 5\% of the global power [1]. In order to address the skyrocket energy cost from the high level resource management aspect, we propose an energy efficient job scheduling approach based on a modified version of Weighted Round Robin scheduler that incorporates VMs reuse and live VM migration without compromising the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Enhanced Weighted Round Robin (EWRR) algorithm enhanced scheduler can monitor the running VMs status for possible VM consolidation or Migration. In addition, VM Manager observes the VMs utilization rate to start live migration from the over-utilizing Processing Element (PE) to under-utilized PEs or to the hibernated PEs by sending WOL (Wake-On-LAN) signal to activate them. Moreover, we have integrated our Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) algorithm in CPU utilization model to specify the required frequency for each task depending on the task complexity and the deadline.",,2014,"Alnowiser, Abdulaziz; Aldhahri, Eman; Alahmadi, Abdulrahman & Zhu, Michelle M.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6822129 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623762.2623848,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Using portfolio theory to diversify the dynamic allocation of web services in the cloud,"In this paper, we view the Cloud as market place for trading instances of Web Services, which can be bought or leased by web applications. Applications can buy diversity by selecting web services from multiple cloud sellers in a cloud based market. We argue that by diversifying the selection, we can improve the dependability of the application and reduce risks associated with Service Level Agreements (SLA) violations. We propose a novel dynamic adaptive search based software engineering approach, which uses portfolio theory to construct a diversify portfolio of web service instances, traded from multiple Cloud providers. The approach systematically evaluates the Quality of Service (QoS) and risks of the portfolio, compare it to the optimal traded portfolio at a given time, and dynamically decide on a new portfolio and adapt the application accordingly.",,2013,"Alrebeish, Faisal & Bahsoon, Rami",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2464576.2464674,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,Resource failures risk assessment modelling in distributed environments,"Service providers offer access to resources and services in distributed environments such as Grids and Clouds through formal Service level Agreements (SLA), and need well-balanced infrastructures so that they can maximise the Quality of Service (QoS) they offer and minimise the number of SLA violations. We propose a mathematical model to predict the risk of failure of resources in such environments using a discrete-time analytical model driven by reliability functions fitted to observed data. The model relies on the resource historical data so as to predict the risk of failure for a given time interval. The model is evaluated by comparing the predicted risk of failure with the observed risk of failure, and is shown to accurately predict the resources risk of failure, allowing a service provider to selectively choose which SLA request to accept.",,2014,"Alsoghayer, Raid & Djemame, Karim",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121213002331 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2565887.2566076,Elsevier Science Inc.,SLA and Cloud
,Intelligent agents for automated cloud computing negotiation,"Presently, cloud providers offer “off-the-shelf” Service Level Agreements (SLA), on a “take it or leave it” basis. This paper, alternatively, proposes customized SLAs. An automated negotiation is needed to establish customized SLAs between service providers and consumers with no previous knowledge of each other. Traditional negotiations between humans are often fraught with difficulty. Thus, in this work, the use of intelligent agents to represent cloud providers and consumers is advocated. Rubinstein's Alternating Offers Protocol offers a suitable technical solution for this challenging problem. The purpose of this paper is to apply the state-of-the-art in negotiation automated algorithms/agents within a described Cloud Computing SLA framework, and to evaluate the most appropriate negotiation approach based on many criteria.",,2014,"Alsrheed, Faisal; El Rhalibi, Abdennour; Randles, Martin & Merabti, Madjid",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6911305,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Monitoring multimedia quality of service in public Cloud Service Level Agreements,"In this paper we propose a model for monitoring Service Level Agreements (SLAs) provided by public Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), such as Amazon and Rackspace, to customers utilizing the cloud infrastructure to deliver multimedia content to their internal and external users. Our approach recommends that an independent neutral third party entity monitors services offered by public CSPs to ensure that the SLAs offered to the clients are honored by the provider. The proposed entity can reduce the likelihood of disputes between the CSP and its customers, since we argue that there is a conflict of interest when a given CSP offers quality of service (QoS) reporting to its customers, because customers cannot independently verify the accuracy of such QoS reports in many cases, as discussed in this paper.",,2012,"Alsulaiman, Laith A. & Alturki, Raad",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6320195,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Dynamic Bandwidth Allocator for Virtual Machines in a Cloud,"Cloud computing is an emergent paradigm that allows to customers to rent infrastructure, platforms and software as a service.

Nevertheless, networking within virtualized cloud still presents some challenges in performance and resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to integrate an SLA-based Dynamic Bandwidth Allocator (DBA) in a vitualized cloud environment. DBA manages bandwidth allocation efficiently through allocating bandwidth according to the application requirements and the established agreement.

,Energy-efficient large-scale computing,"Large-scale computing can be used to characterize the host infrastructures of internet-services, social networks and cloud services, the growing pervasiveness of which has been undeniable in recent years. Although the utilization of these services has triggered significant growth in several areas such as science, communication, education and health-care, to name a few, it has not come without a cost. Specifically, the operation of large-scale infrastructures can result in energy consumptions equivalent to the energy budget of a medium-sized city. The deployment of such infrastructures requires hunders of kgs of primary materials and fossil fuels, while releasing significant amounts of CO 2 into the atmosphere.
Energy is wasted across all layers of large-scale systems. One significant source of inefficiency is the overprovisioning of the hardware. Internet-services have typically very strict performance guarantees, defined in Service-Level Agreements, which result in overprovisioning of both the computing and the supporting equipment. The manufacturing of the extra equipment is a burden to the environment. The operation of the computing equipment at periods of low-utilization, which is the majority of the time, wastes a lot of energy because server HW tends to be energy-inefficient at low utilizations. Another significant source of inefficiency is the software, which is not designed both to maximize energy-savings and optimize performance.

In datacenter planning, industry experts utilize methodologies to calculate the total cost/profit. We propose to include the environmental cost in current methodologies. With this, we demonstrate that large installations can be more energy-efficient compared to smaller ones. To tackle the cluster overprovisioning problem, researchers have proposed both HW and SW solutions. In HW, researchers have proposed the usage of low-power servers which transition all the server components into a low-power state fast. In SW, algorithms which consolidate the load into a subset of servers at periods of low utilization have been proposed. Unfortunately these solutions do not allow access to the memory during load consolidation, even though memory is a critical resource for the performance of internet-services. We propose both a memory-active, low-power family of server states and cluster middleware software which enables the management of the memory during consolidation. Our energy-efficient SW and HW achieve up to 38% energy savings in a datacenter cluster running an internet-service, over an energy-oblivious cluster. At the server level, dynamic power management solutions for the CPU and the DRAM may degrade performance with application complexities, such as highly dynamic loads or strided memory access patterns. We propose an SLA-aware power governor for the CPU and a locality-aware power management technique for the DRAM. Our CPU technique saves up to 8% system energy over the default power governor of the Linux kernel for a highly dynamic enterprise workload, while our DRAM technique improves the ED2 by 21% on average for an enterprise and scientific suite of benchmarks over a static-only power-optimized memory system.

Overall, this thesis demonstrates that large-scale systems have the capacibility to be more energy-efficient, so long that energy-efficiency is integrated as a design goal throughout the large-scale system stack.",,2012,"Anagnostopoulou, Vlasia",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2521009,University of California at Santa Barbara,SLA and Cloud
,Always On: Architecture for High Availability Cloud Applications,"With the shift towards cloud computing, application availability becomes a valid concern. Cloud applications have to be taken down to address various hardware and software problems. Even thoug redundancy insulates applications from hardware errors, the software updates and patches still require the service to be taken down for the period of the update. Organizations generally use lowactivity hours to do software updates. This paper proposes architecture for constructing high-availability cloud applications that can be updated without shutting down the service. The paper discusses how the various components of application can be structured into request receiver nodes and request processor nodes. Request receivers receive the request and request processors act on the request. We provide a mechanism of detecting whether any worker or responder node is not working optimally and allow user to save the state and restart this particular node. Finally we present scenarios wherein these nodes can be upgraded either individually or in batches. This reduces dependency on administrators and operations engineers in data center thereby reducing the cost. The reduced cost can directly benefit cost sensitive emerging markets. Furthermore this improves the service level agreement (SLA) since the application will not have to be taken down for updates.",,2012,"Anand, Manu",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6354593,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Scalable Architecture for Real-Time Monitoring of Large Information Systems,"Data centers supporting cloud-based services are characterized by a huge number of hardware and software resources often cooperating in complex and unpredictable ways. Understanding the state of these systems for reasons of management and service level agreement requires scalable monitoring architectures that should gather and evaluate continuosly large flows in almost real-time periods. We propose a novel monitoring architecture that, by combining a hierarchical approach with decentralized monitors, addresses these challenges. In this context, fully centralized systems do not scale to the required number of flows, while pure peer-to-peer architectures cannot provide a global view of the system state. We evaluate the monitoring architecture for computational units of gathering and evaluation in real contexts that demonstrate the scalability potential of the proposed system.",,2012,"Andreolini, Mauro; Colajanni, Michele & Pietri, Marcello",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6472471,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Exploiting Non-Dedicated Resources for Cloud Computing,"Popular web services and applications such as Google Apps, DropBox, and Go.Pc introduce a wasteful imbalance of processing resources. Each host operated by a provider serves hundreds to thousands of users, treating their PCs as thin clients. Tapping the processing, storage and networking capacities of these non-dedicated resources promises to reduce the size of required hardware basis significantly. Consequently, it presents a noteworthy opportunity for service providers and operators of cloud computing infrastructures. We investigate how a mixture of dedicated (and so highly available) hosts and non-dedicated (and so highly volatile) hosts can be used to provision a processing tier of a large-scale web service. We discuss an operational model which guarantees long-term availability despite of host churn, and study multiple aspects necessary to implement it. These include: ranking of non-dedicated hosts according to their long-term availability behavior, short-term availability modeling of these hosts, and simulation of migration and group availability levels using real-world availability data from 10,000 non-dedicated hosts. We also study the tradeoff between a larger share of dedicated hosts vs. higher migration rate in terms of costs and SLA objectives. This yields an optimization approach where a service provider can find a suitable balance between costs and service quality. The experimental results show that it is possible to achieve a wide spectrum of such modes, ranging from 3.6 USD/hour to 5 USD/hour for a group of at least 50 hosts available with probability greater than 0.90.",,2010,"Andrzejak, Artur; Kondo, Derrick & Anderson, David P.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5488488 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.156.4276,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Decision Model for Cloud Computing under SLA Constraints,"With the recent introduction of Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), users can bid for resources and thus control the balance of reliability versus monetary costs. A critical challenge is to determine bid prices that minimize monetary costs for a user while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA) constraints (for example, sufficient resource availability to complete a computation within a desired deadline). We propose a probabilistic model for the optimization of monetary costs, performance, and reliability, given user and application requirements and dynamic conditions. Using real instance price traces and workload models, we evaluate our model and demonstrate how users should bid optimally on Spot Instances to reach different objectives with desired levels of confidence.",,2010,"Andrzejak, Artur; Kondo, Derrick & Yi, Sangho",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1906481.1906533 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5581588,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,PROFIT MAXIMIZATION FOR SAAS USING SLA BASED SPOT PRICING IN CLOUD COMPUTING,"Cloud Computing provides user a complete software environment. To serve resources to customers, Software as a Service providers rent resources from the Infrastructure as a Service Providers. Client applications and service providers negotiate for the sales of services by means of Service Level Agreement (SLA) that acts as a contract between them. Depending on the status of the demand, Infrastructure as a Service provider is able to offer higher or lower prices for maximising its profit. So it is difficult to establish a profitable pricing function for Software as a Service Providers. Therefore, this paper proposes spot pricing strategy to estimate the bid according to the used specified constraints of the user and also optimizing the pricing level to improve the profit of Saas providers. We also have analyzed the performance of Spot Pricing Scheme with different Scenario to maximize the Saas providers profit.",,,"Ani, N. & Mary, Brown",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.414.312,,SLA and Cloud
,Improving management of distributed services using correlations and predictions in SLA-driven cloud computing systems,"Recent advancements in cloud computing have enabled the proliferation of distributed applications, which require management and control of multiple services. However, without an efficient mechanism for scaling services in response to changing environmental conditions and number of users, application performance might suffer, leading to Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations and inefficient use of hardware resources. We introduce a system for controlling the complexity of scaling applications composed of multiple services using mechanisms based on fulfillment of SLAs. We present how service monitoring information can be used in conjunction with service level objectives, predictions, and correlations between performance indicators for optimizing the allocation of services belonging to distributed applications. We validate our models using experiments and simulations involving a distributed enterprise information system.

,Modeling and simulation of concurrent workload processing in cloud-distributed enterprise information systems,"Cloud Computing enables provisioning and distribution of highly scalable services in a reliable, on-demand and sustainable manner. Distributed Enterprise Information Systems (dEIS) are a class of applications with important economic value and with strong requirements in terms of performance and reliability. In order to validate dEIS architectures, stability, scaling and SLA compliance, large testing deployments are necessary, adding complexity to the design and testing of such systems. To fill this gap, we present and validate a methodology for modeling and simulating such complex distributed systems using the CloudSim cloud computing simulator, based on measurement data from an actual distributed system. We present an approach for creating a performance-based model of a distributed cloud application using recorded service performance traces. We then show how to integrate the created model into CloudSim. We validate the CloudSim simulation model by comparing performance traces gathered during distributed concurrent experiments with simulation results using different VM configurations.

,Dynamic Optimization of SLA-Based Services Scaling Rules,"Current advanced cloud infrastructure management solutions allow scheduling actions for dynamically changing the number of running virtual machines (VMs). This approach, however, does not guarantee that the scheduled number of VMs will properly handle the actual user generated workload, especially if the user utilization patterns will change. We propose using a dynamically generated scaling model for the VMs containing the services of the distributed applications, which is able to react to the variations in the number of application users. We answer the following question: How to dynamically decide how many services of each type are needed in order to handle a larger workload within the same time constraints? We describe a mechanism for dynamically composing the SLAs for controlling the scaling of distributed services by combining data analysis mechanisms with application benchmarking using multiple VM configurations. Based on processing of multiple application benchmarks generated data sets we discover a set of service monitoring metrics able to predict critical Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. By combining this set of predictor metrics with a heuristic for selecting the appropriate scaling-out paths for the services of distributed applications, we show how SLA scaling rules can be inferred and then used for controlling the runtime scale-in and scale-out of distributed services. We validate our architecture and models by performing scaling experiments with a distributed application representative for the enterprise class of information systems.

In this paper, we propose novel capacity allocation algorithms able to coordinate multiple distributed resource controllers operating in geographically distributed cloud sites. Capacity allocation solutions are integrated with a load redirection mechanism which, when necessary, distributes incoming requests among different sites. The overall goal is to minimize the costs of allocated resources in terms of virtual machines, while guaranteeing SLA constraints expressed as a threshold on the average response time. We propose a distributed solution which integrates workload prediction and distributed non-linear optimization techniques. Experiments show how the proposed solutions improve other heuristics proposed in literature without penalizing SLAs, and our results are close to the global optimum which can be obtained by an oracle with a perfect knowledge about the future offered load.",,2012,"Ardagna, Danilo; Casolari, Sara; Colajanni, Michele & Panicucci, Barbara",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2206440.2206647 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731512000585,"Academic Press, Inc.",SLA and Cloud
,A Game Theoretic Formulation of the Service Provisioning Problem in Cloud Systems,"Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm which allows the on-demand delivering of software, hardware, and data as services. As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic, the development of efficient service provisioning policies become increasingly challenging. Game theoretic approaches have shown to gain a thorough analytical understanding of the service provisioning problem.

In this paper we take the perspective of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers which host their applications at an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. Each SaaS needs to comply with quality of service requirements, specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts with the end-users, which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level. SaaS providers want to maximize their revenues from SLAs, while minimizing the cost of use of resources supplied by the IaaS provider. Moreover, SaaS providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources. On the other hand, the IaaS wants to maximize the revenues obtained providing virtualized resources. In this paper we model the service provisioning problem as a Generalized Nash game, and we propose an efficient algorithm for the run time management and allocation of IaaS resources to competing SaaSs.",,2011,"Ardagna, Danilo; Di Milano, Politecnico; Panicucci, Barbara & Passacantando, Mauro",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1963405.1963433 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.205.9412,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,Generalized Nash Equilibria for the Service Provisioning Problem in Cloud Systems,"In recent years, the evolution and the widespread adoption of virtualization, service-oriented architectures, autonomic, and utility computing have converged letting a new paradigm to emerge: cloud computing. Clouds allow the on-demand delivering of software, hardware, and data as services. Currently, the cloud offer is becoming wider day by day because all the major IT companies and service providers, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, HP, IBM, and VMWare, have started providing solutions involving this new technological paradigm. As cloud-based services are more numerous and dynamic, the development of efficient service provisioning policies becomes increasingly challenging. In this paper, we take the perspective of Software as a Service (SaaS) providers that host their applications at an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. Each SaaS needs to comply with quality-of-service requirements, specified in service-level agreement (SLA) contracts with the end users, which determine the revenues and penalties on the basis of the achieved performance level. SaaS providers want to maximize their revenues from SLAs, while minimizing the cost of use of resources supplied by the IaaS provider. Moreover, SaaS providers compete and bid for the use of infrastructural resources. On the other hand, the IaaS wants to maximize the revenues obtained providing virtualized resources. In this paper, we model the service provisioning problem as a generalized Nash game and we show the existence of equilibria for such game. Moreover, we propose two solution methods based on the best-reply dynamics, and we prove their convergence in a finite number of iterations to a generalized Nash equilibrium. In particular, we develop an efficient distributed algorithm for the runtime allocation of IaaS resources among competing SaaS providers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by simulation and performing tests on a real prototype environment deployed on Amazon EC2.

,From Software as a good to software as a service: Preparing the evolution of software products into the cloud,"Summary form only given. The speed of change in Internet Technologies continues to be impressive and the current “Future Internet” based society increasingly relies on software at all levels. Nevertheless, software systems continue to suffer from aging symptoms caused by the inherent factors of the software modernization process: inevitable; unpredictable; costly; difficult; time- and resource-consuming; poorly supported by tools, techniques or formalisms; poorly understood and maintained; undervalued in traditional software development processes, etc. Furthermore, current technological and business innovations (such as Cloud Computing and Software as a Service (SaaS) concepts) are changing the way in which software is designed, developed, tested, delivered and consumed. All this means that new requirements, never seen before in software development, have to be faced (scalability, multi-tenancy support, usage monitoring, security, SLA compliance, etc.). These challenges are even greater when adapting previously developed software to this new landscape. Different approaches (reverse engineering, ADM, or service-oriented-architecture modernization) have to be analyzed depending on the source language, architecture, target market or available resources. As a result, the complete software life cycle, from requirements to runtime and delivery, has to be re-adapted to the new technological and business conditions, needs and challenges, thus increasing the need of advanced means to support software evolution and adaptation as a key value for the next-generation service-based software modernization. One particular example of complex system modernization is the exposure of legacy systems as SaaS. Model-driven techniques have been used for several years to cope with the challenge of transformation of legacy systems as SaaS. Regardless of the positive features of these techniques, for legacy systems there are many challenges such as are the availability of arc- itectural models describing the system (typically unavailable for legacy systems), the ability to transform the original system into new ones compatible with targeted infrastructures and frameworks, and the support for adaptive deployment. All these features are particular relevant when deploying legacy applications as SaaS on the Web, for instance using different Cloud offerings. Desirable solutions are those that can automate the transformation of existing legacy systems that require being transformed into modern ones exposed as services (SaaS) compatible with modern technology frameworks. This keynote will present the challenges and needs, as well as the results obtained so far in this novel architecture and business model based on the cloud.",,2012,"Arrieta, Leire Orue-Echevarria",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6392595,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Self-Control Cloud Services,We introduce a self-control integrated service component aiming at ensuring Service Level Agreement management. Our approach based on quality of service has two important points: the contract description (supply and demand) and the contract management. The self-control in service components allows us to react dynamically (operational decision) and the autonomic loop enables us to manage the services composition in a virtual session (tactical and strategic decision). This approach is proposed in the Open Cloud ware project.

,MORPHOSYS: Efficient Colocation of QoS-Constrained Workloads in the Cloud,"In hosting environments such as IaaS clouds, desirable application performance is usually guaranteed through the use of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which specify minimal fractions of resource capacities that must be allocated for unencumbered use for proper operation. Arbitrary colocation of applications with different SLAs on a single host may result in inefficient utilization of the host's resources. In this paper, we propose that periodic resource allocation and consumption models -- often used to characterize real-time workloads -- be used for a more granular expression of SLAs. Our proposed SLA model has the salient feature that it exposes flexibilities that enable the infrastructure provider to safely transform SLAs from one form to another for the purpose of achieving more efficient colocation. Towards that goal, we present MORPHOSYS: a framework for a service that allows the manipulation of SLAs to enable efficient colocation of arbitrary workloads in a dynamic setting. We present results from extensive trace-driven simulations of colocated Video-on-Demand servers in a cloud setting. These results show that potentially-significant reduction in wasted resources (by as much as 60\%) are possible using MORPHOSYS.",,2012,"unknown Authors; Ishakian, Vatche & Bestavros, Azer",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217409 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310132 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.299.5667,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Agents Based Monitoring of Heterogeneous Cloud Infrastructures,"Monitoring of resources is one among the major challenges that the virtualization brings with it within the Cloud environment since the user applications are often distributed on several nodes whose location is unknown a priori and can dynamically change. Consumers need to monitor their resources for checking that service levels are continuously compliant with the agreed SLA and for detecting under-utilization or overloading conditions of their resources. Furthermore the monitoring of service levels becomes critical because of the conflicts of interest that might occur between provider and customer in case of outage. In this paper a framework that supports the monitoring of Cloud infrastructure is presented. It provides to the user the possibility to check the state of his/her resources, even if they have been acquired from heterogeneous vendors. The proposed environment will offer high elasticity and extensibility by the provisioning of an high level of customization of the performance indexes and metrics.",,2013,"Aversa, Rocco; Tasquier, Luca & Venticinque, Salvatore",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6726254 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2573041.2574179,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Management of Cloud Infrastructures through Agents,"In the Cloud context, the monitoring of service levels becomes critical because of the conflicts of interest that might occur between provider and customer in case of outage. Here we focus on Cloud monitoring at infrastructure level (IaaS), but with the perspective of a Cloud customer. Cloud customers cannot check the compliance of the Service Level Agreement (SLA) trusting the monitoring service of their own Cloud provider. In fact the Cloud provider has a conflicting interest ensuring the guarantees on service levels it provides. Besides Cloud customers need to detect under-utilization and overload conditions to take decisions about load balancing and resource reconfiguration. In this paper we present an agency that is deployed in the Cloud together with the customer's applications and can be used to configure a monitoring infrastructure. Mobile software agents take measures inside the Cloud resources, which are completely under the customer's administration, collect performance information and compute metrics according to the user's requirements. They implement a provider independent monitoring of the Cloud infrastructure during the execution of applications.",,2012,"Aversa, Rocco; Tasquier, Luca & Venticinque, Salvatore",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6354720 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2410134.2410174,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

It focuses on the sharing of information and computation in a large network that are quite likely to be owned by geographically disbursed different vendors. The proposed Bin packing based algorithm tries to maximize the resource utilization in a cloud datacenter and thereby increasing the profit of that cloud provider. In the proposed system, Best-fit -- Worst-fit strategy efficiently places the virtual machines to the less number of active physical servers. The jobs are scheduled using best-fit approach.

,A Cloud Service Broker for SLA-based SaaS provisioning,"The growing adoption of cloud computing and the proliferation of Internet-enabled handheld devices are changing the services landscape. Given the abundance and the variety of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings, we propose, in this paper, a framework for SaaS provisioning, which relies on brokered Service Level agreements (SLAs), between service consumers and SaaS providers. A Cloud Service Broker (CSB) helps consumers selecting the right SaaS provider that can fulfill their functional and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Its Selection Manager component ranks SaaS providers by matching their QoS offerings against the QoS requirements of the service consumer. Furthermore, the CSB is in charge of negotiating the SLA terms - using a multi-attributes negotiation model - with a selected SaaS provider on behalf of the service consumer, and monitoring the compliance to the SLA during its implementation.",,2013,"Badidi, E.",,,SLA and Cloud
,Cloud testing tools,"Cloud platform provides an infrastructure for resource sharing, software hosting and service delivering in a pay-per-use approach. To test the cloud-based software systems, techniques and tools are necessary to address unique quality concerns of the cloud infrastructure such as massive scalability and dynamic configuration.

The paper makes a survey of representative approaches and typical tools for cloud testing. It identifies the needs for cloud testing tools including multi-layer testing, SLA-based testing, large scale simulation, and on-demand test environment. To address the needs, it investigates the new architecture and techniques for designing testing tools for the cloud and in the cloud.

,Vee@Cloud: the virtual test lab on the cloud,"Large-scale system testing is challenging. It usually requires large number of test cases, substantial resources, and geographical distributed usage scenarios. It is expensive to build the test environment and to achieve certain level of test confidence. To address the challenges, test systems need to be scalable in a cost-effective manner. TaaS (Testing-as-a-Service) promotes a Cloud-based testing architecture to provide online testing services following a pay-per-use business model. The paper introduces the research and implementation of a TaaS system called Vee@Cloud. It serves as a scalable virtual test lab built upon Cloud infrastructure services. The resource manager allocates Virtual Machine instances and deploy test tasks, from a pool of available resources across different Clouds. The workload generator simulates various workload patterns, especially for system with new architecture styles like Web 2.0 and big data processing. Vee@Cloud promotes continuous monitoring and evaluating of online services. The monitor collects real-time performance data and analyzes the data against SLA (Service Level Agreement).

,Making the Venus Concept Watch 1.0,"Over the past year we have celebrated the 50th anniversary of planetary exploration, which started with the Venus flyby of Mariner-2; and the 35th anniversary of the Pioneer-Venus multi-probe mission where one large and three small probes descended to the surface of Venus, encountering extreme environmental conditions. At the surface of Venus the temperature is about 460°C, and the pressure is 92bar, with a highly corrosive super-critical CO2 atmosphere. At a Venusian altitude of 50km the pressure and temperature conditions are near Earth-like, but the clouds carry sulfuric acid droplets. Deep probe missions to Jupiter and Saturn, targeting the 100bar pressure depth encounter similar pressure and temperature conditions as the Pioneer-Venus probes did. Mitigating these environments is highly challenging and requires special considerations for designs and materials. While assessing such space mission concepts, we have found that there is an overlap between the extreme environments in planetary atmospheres and the environments experienced by deep-sea explorers back on Earth. Consequently, the mitigation approaches could be also similar between planetary probes and diver watches. For example, both need to tolerate about 100bar of pressure—although high temperatures are not factors on Earth. Mitigating these environments, the potential materials are: titanium for the probe and the watch housing; sapphire for the window and glass; resin impregnated woven carbon fiber for the aeroshell׳s thermal protection system and for the face of the watch; and nylon ribbon for the parachute and for the watch band. Planetary probes also utilize precision watches; thus there is yet another crosscutting functionality with diver watches. Our team, from the Innovation Design Engineering Program of the Royal College of Art, has designed and built a concept watch to commemorate these historical events, while highlighting advances in manufacturing processes over the past three to five decades, relevant to both future planetary mission designs and can be used to produce deep diver watches. In this paper we describe our design considerations; give a brief overview of the extreme environments these components would experience on both Venus and Earth; the manufacturing techniques and materials we used to build the Venus Watch; and its outreach potential to bring a distant concept of planetary exploration closer to Earth. We will also address lessons learned from this project and new ideas forward, for the next generation of this concept design.",,2014,"Balint, Tibor S. & Melchiorri, Julian P.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576514001477,,SLA and Cloud
,Quality Assessment of Software as a Service on Cloud Using Fuzzy Logic,"Cloud computing is a business model which provides on demand services on the pay-per-use premise. Software as a Service (SaaS) is one of the delivery models for cloud computing, where software ownership by the SaaS provider is isolated from its use by the SaaS customer. The notion of quality is central to any service provision. Also, it is important to evaluate the quality of SaaS in order to be able to improve it. Traditional software engineering quality models are not effusively suitable for this purpose due to difference in the nature of software and service. In the past, a few approaches to service quality estimation have been proposed. Some of these approaches extend quality characteristics from existing quality models and even devise SaaS quality metrics, while others discuss quality around Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. In this paper, some representative quality factors have been identified by analyzing literature and a model based on fuzzy logic has been proposed to assess SaaS quality. Such a model of quality criteria may provide a ground for more comprehensive quality model which may assist a SaaS customer to choose a higher quality service from available services on cloud; the quality model may also serve as a guideline to SaaS provider to improve the quality of service provided.",,2013,"Baliyan, Niyati & Kumar, Sandeep",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6684439,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Autonomic scaling of Cloud Computing resources using BN-based prediction models,"The recent surge in the popularity and usage of Cloud Computing services by both the enterprise and individual consumers has necessitated efficient and proactive management of data center resources which host services having varied characteristics. One of the major issues concerning both the cloud service providers and consumers is the automatic scalability of resources (i.e., compute, storage and bandwidth) in response to the highly unpredictable demands. To this end, an opportunity exists to harness the predictive and diagnostic capabilities of machine learning approaches to incorporate dynamic scaling up and scaling down of resources without violating the Service Level Agreements (SLA) and simultaneously ensuring adequate revenue to the providers. This paper proposes, implements and evaluates a Bayesian Networks based predictive modeling framework to provide for an autonomic scaling of utility computing resources in the Cloud Computing scenario. In essence, the BN-based model captures the historical behavior of the system involving various performance metrics (indicators) and predicts the desired unknown metric (e.g. SLA parameter). Initial simulated experiments involving random demand scenarios provide insights into the feasibility and applicability of the proposed approach for improving the management of present data center facilities.",,2013,"Bashar, Abul",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6710578,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Generic Architecture for Demand Response: The ALL4Green Approach,"Demand Response is a mechanism used in power grids to manage customers' power consumption during critical situations (e.g. power shortage). Data centres are good candidates to participate in Demand Response programs due to their high energy use. In this paper, we present a generic architecture to enable Demand Response between Energy Provider and Data Centres realised in All4Green. To this end, we show our three-level concept and then illustrate the building blocks of All4Green's architectural design. Furthermore, we introduce the novel aspects of Green SDA and Green SLA for Energy Provider-Data centre sub-ecosystem as well as Data centre-IT Client sub-ecosystem respectively. In order to further reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission, the notion of data centre federation is introduced: savings can be expected if data centres start to collaborate by exchanging workload. Also, we specify the technological solutions necessary to implement our proposed architectural approach. Finally, we present preliminary proof-of-concept experiments, conducted both on traditional and cloud computing data centres, which show relatively encouraging results.",,2013,"Basmadjian, Robert; Lovasz, Gergo; Beck, Michael; Meer, Hermann De; Hesselbach-Serra, Xavier; Botero, Juan Felipe; Klingert, Sonja; Ortega, Maria Perez; Lopez, Juan Carlos; Stam, Andries; Krevelen, Rick Van & Girolamo, Marco Di",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686071 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2569433.2569891,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Approximation algorithms for energy minimization in Cloud service allocation under reliability constraints,"We consider allocation problems that arise in the context of service allocation in Clouds. More specifically, we assume on the one part that each computing resource is associated with a capacity, that can be chosen using the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) method, and with a probability of failure. On the other hand, we assume that the services run as a set of independent instances of identical Virtual Machines (VMs). Moreover, there exists a Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the Cloud provider and the client that can be expressed as follows: the client comes with a minimal number of service instances that must be alive at anytime, and the Cloud provider offers a list of pairs (price, compensation), the compensation having to be paid by the Cloud provider if it fails to keep alive the required number of services. On the Cloud provider side, each pair actually corresponds to a guaranteed reliability of fulfilling the constraint on the minimal number of instances. In this context, given a minimal number of instances and a probability of success, the question for the Cloud provider is to find the number of necessary resources, their clock frequency and an allocation of the instances (possibly using replication) onto machines. This solution should satisfy all types of constraints (both capacity and reliability constraints). Moreover, it should remain valid during a time period (with a given reliability in presence of failures) while minimizing the energy consumption of used resources. We assume in this paper that this time period, that typically takes place between two redistributions, is fixed and known in advance. We prove deterministic approximation ratios on the consumed energy for algorithms that provide guaranteed reliability and we provide an extensive set of simulations that prove that homogeneous solutions are close to optimal.",,2013,"Beaumont, Olivier; Duchon, Philippe & Renaud-Goud, Paul",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.414.1618 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6799123,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Reliable Service Allocation in Clouds,"We consider several reliability problems that arise when allocating applications to processing resources in a Cloud computing platform. More specifically, we assume on the one hand that each computing resource is associated to a capacity constraint and to a probability of failure. On the other hand, we assume that each service runs as a set of independent instances of identical Virtual Machines, and that the Service Level Agreement between the Cloud provider and the client states that a minimal number of instances of the service should run with a given probability. In this context, given the capacity and failure probabilities of the machines, and the capacity and reliability demands of the services, the question for the cloud provider is to find an allocation of the instances of the services (possibly using replication) onto machines satisfying all types of constraints during a given time period. In this paper, our goal is to assess the impact of the reliability constraint on the complexity of resource allocation problems. We consider several variants of this problem, depending on the number of services and whether their reliability demand is individual or global. We prove several fundamental complexity results (\#P' and NP-completeness results) and we provide several optimal and approximation algorithms. In particular, we prove that a basic randomized allocation algorithm, that is easy to implement, provides optimal or quasi-optimal results in several contexts, and we show through simulations that it also achieves very good results in more general settings.",,2013,"Beaumont, Olivier; Eyraud-Dubois, Lionel & Larcheveque, Hubert",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2510661.2511428 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6569800,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Trust Management Solution in the Context of Hybrid Clouds,"Cloud computing is a revolutionary paradigm which enables on-demand provisioning of computing resources. Resources are delivered to cloud consumers in the form of infrastructure, platform and software services. These resources are deployed on three different models: private clouds, public clouds and hybrid clouds. In hybrid cloud context, private clouds externalize resources and invoke services from a public cloud when needed. However, in such a specific inter-cloud environment risks may arise. In fact, private cloud users often interact with cloud providers for services provisioning such as infrastructure, platforms and software. However, they are not sufficiently assured about how credible the data computed by these resources they have entrusted. This is due to clouds autonomy preservation, difference in control policy definitions and lack of transparency in clouds. In this paper, we propose a preventive/detective approach for assessing private cloud to select a trustworthy public cloud service. The solution is based on a mediator as a service that ensures the role of trust manager for the private cloud.",,2014,"Bennani, Nadia; Boukadi, Khouloud & Ghedira-Guegan, Chirine",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2681967.2682244 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6927079,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Distributed Architecture for the Monitoring of Clouds and CDNs: Applications to Amazon AWS,"Clouds and CDNs are systems that tend to separate the content being requested by users from the physical servers capable of serving it. From the network point of view, monitoring and optimizing performance for the traffic they generate is a challenging task, given the same resource can be located in multiple places, which can in turn change at any time. The first step in understanding Cloud and CDN systems is thus the engineering of a monitoring platform. In this paper, we propose a novel solution which combines passive and active measurements, and whose workflow has been tailored to specifically characterize the traffic generated by Cloud and CDN infrastructures. We validate our platform by performing a longitudinal characterization of the very well known Cloud and CDN infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services (AWS). By observing the traffic generated by more than 50,000 Internet users of an Italian ISP, we explore the EC2, S3 and CloudFront AWS services, unveiling their infrastructure, the pervasiveness of web-services they host, and their traffic allocation policies as seen from our vantage points. Most importantly, we observe their evolution over a twoyear long period. The solution provided in this paper can be of interest for i) developers aiming at building measurement tools for Cloud Infrastructure Providers, ii) developers interested in failure and anomaly detection systems, and iii) third-party SLA certificators who can design systems to independently monitor performance. At last, we believe the results about AWS presented in this paper are interesting as they are among the first to unveil properties of AWS as seen from the operator point of view.",,2014,"Bermudez, Ignacio; Traverso, Stefano; Munafo, Maurizio & Mellia, Marco",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6920067,,SLA and Cloud
,Adaptive Scheduling on Power-Aware Managed Data-Centers Using Machine Learning,"Energy-related costs have become one of the major economic factors in IT data-centers, and companies and the research community are currently working on new efficient power-aware resource management strategies, also known as ""Green IT"". Here we propose a framework for autonomic scheduling of tasks and web-services on cloud environments, optimizing the profit taking into account revenue for task execution minus penalties for service-level agreement violations, minus power consumption cost. The principal contribution is the combination of consolidation and virtualization technologies, mathematical optimization methods, and machine learning techniques. The data-center infrastructure, tasks to execute, and desired profit are casted as a mathematical programming model, which can then be solved in different ways to find good task scheduling. We use an exact solver based on mixed linear programming as a proof of concept but, since it is an NP-complete problem, we show that approximate solvers provide valid alternatives for finding approximately optimal schedules. The machine learning is used to estimate the initially unknown parameters of the mathematical model. In particular, we need to predict a priori resource usage (such as CPU consumption) by different tasks under current workloads, and estimate task service-level-agreement (such as response time) given workload features, host characteristics, and contention among tasks in the same host. Experiments show that machine learning algorithms can predict system behavior with acceptable accuracy, and that their combination with the exact or approximate schedulers manages to allocate tasks to hosts striking a balance between revenue for executed tasks, quality of service, and power consumption.",,2011,"Berral, Josep Ll.; Gavald\`{a}, Ricard; Torres, Jordi & Gavalda, Ricard",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2082076.2082091 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6076500 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.297.376,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Adaptive SLA monitoring of service choreographies enacted on the Cloud,"The deployment and the execution of applications on dynamic Cloud infrastructures introduces new requirements of adaptability with respect to monitoring. Specifically, the governance of service choreographies enacted over Cloud-based solutions relies on the observation and analysis of events happening at different abstraction layers. Adaptability requirements are even more evident when monitoring deals with Service Level Agreements (SLA) established among the choreography participants. In fact, as the Cloud paradigm offers on-demand solutions as a service, often monitoring rules cannot be completely defined off-line. Thus also the monitoring infrastructure must keep track of the continuous evolution of the underlying environment, and adapt itself accordingly. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-source monitoring architecture that can synthesize on-the-fly SLA monitoring rules following the evolution of the Cloud infrastructure. We demonstrate the idea on a case study and discuss limitations as well as planned further advancements.",,2013,"Bertolino, Antonia; Calabro, Antonello & De Angelis, Guglielmo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6632741,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Ensuring accountability for application sharing in the cloud,"Cloud is a host based network service on the basis of service over internet. When large number of users shares the applications for uploading, downloading and access control, then there will be hazard of fraud access in the network. If accountability is improved, then due to some accountability constraint, system performance reduces. Here we propose the Push Pull key matching algorithm which performs accountability and also improves the performance of system by 56\% than existing system. The cloud accountability framework is designed which consist of registration manager, log manager and actual application. Registration manager performs the service level agreement which is done by cloud service provider. When cloud service provider registers, then he gets the key of UID and IP address. Accordingly the log manager built a key and Push this key securely by encryption process. In encryption process, temporal attribute base encryption and advanced encryption standard is used for security purpose. The application filter is used to performing access role of the system. These roles are assigned by cloud service provider after completing service level agreement.",,2013,"Bhole, Ashish T. & Rajput, Satpalsing D.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6724146,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,On the Characterization of the Structural Robustness of Data Center Networks,"Data centers being an architectural and functional block of cloud computing are integral to the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector. Cloud computing is rigorously utilized by various domains, such as agriculture, nuclear science, smart grids, healthcare, and search engines for research, data storage, and analysis. A Data Center Network (DCN) constitutes the communicational backbone of a data center, ascertaining the performance boundaries for cloud infrastructure. The DCN needs to be robust to failures and uncertainties to deliver the required Quality of Service (QoS) level and satisfy Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze robustness of the state-of-the-art DCNs. Our major contributions are: (a) we present multi-layered graph modeling of various DCNs; (b) we study the classical robustness metrics considering various failure scenarios to perform a comparative analysis; (c) we present the inadequacy of the classical network robustness metrics to appropriately evaluate the DCN robustness; and (d) we propose new procedures to quantify the DCN robustness.

However, this priority strategy of users is relatively simple, and cannot adapt to dynamic change of resources, it is inevitable to reduce the QoS. In order to improve QoS, we refer to the economic model and resource scheduling model of cloud computing, use SAL (Service Level Agreement) as pricing strategy, on the basis of DBC algorithm, propose an DABP (Deadline And Budget Priority based on DBC) algorithm for ForCES networks, DABP combines both budget and time priority to scheduling.

,Analysis of Response Time Percentile Service Level Agreements in SOA-Based Applications,"A large number of enterprise, web-based, distributed software applications are designed on Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles and hosted in large scale datacenters managed by cloud providers. Typically, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are negotiated between the consumers of the cloud platform services and the cloud provider. In this work, we consider SLAs that involve percentiles of response times as part of the performance metrics; the SLAs stipulate that a penalty be charged to the cloud provider if the SLA targets are not met. The main motivation for considering such SLAs is their potential for price differentiation. We focus our analysis on the effects the penalty function has on the achieved response time percentiles. In particular, we analyze the effect of three commonly deployed choices (linear, exponential or step-wise functions) to relate the penalty charged and the achieved percentile. This analysis is NP-hard, so we employ a heuristic algorithm that is based on simulated annealing. Our results indicate that the linear penalty charging function is ""best'' in the sense that it maximizes the achieved response time percentiles.",,2011,"Boloor, K.; Chirkova, R.; Salo, T. & Viniotis, Y.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6133866,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Management of SOA-Based Context-Aware Applications Hosted in a Distributed Cloud Subject to Percentile Constraints,"We consider geographically distributed datacenters forming a collectively managed cloud computing system. Multiple SaaS providers host their SOA-based, context-aware applications in the cloud. Typically, the context-aware applications serve multiple classes of customers (end users) classified on economic considerations, which determine the Quality of Service (QoS) received by each class. This need for differentiated QoS for each customer class is incorporated into a Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiated between the context-aware application provider and the cloud provider. A QoS metric that has been explored in large distributed applications is the percentile of response times, this metric provides a form of guarantees on the shape of the response time distribution for the customer. Typical SLAs require the response time of a certain percentile of the input requests from particular classes of customers to be less than a specified value, if this value is exceeded, a penalty is charged to the cloud provider. In addition, the applications we consider are data-intensive with strict temporal order constraints that have to be enforced on requests within the same session of a customer. We propose Data-aware Session-grained Allocation with gi-FIFO Scheduling (DSAgS), a novel decentralized request management scheme deployed in each of the geographically distributed datacenters, to globally reduce the penalty charged to the cloud computing system. Our simulation evaluation shows that our dynamic scheme far outperforms commonly deployed management policies (typically employing static or random allocation with First In First Out, Weighted Round Robin or dynamic priority-based scheduling). We further optimize our solution for dynamic, data-intensive context-aware applications, by proposing a ""context level"" cache replacement policy.

,Platform-as-a-Service Architecture for Real-Time Quality of Service Management in Clouds,"Cloud computing offers the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of software services through the commoditization of information technology assets and on-demand usage patterns. However, the complexity of determining resource provision policies for applications in such complex environments introduces significant inefficiencies and has driven the emergence of a new class of infrastructure called Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). In this paper, we present a novel PaaS architecture being developed in the EU IST IRMOS project targeting real-time Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for online interactive multimedia applications. The architecture considers the full service lifecycle including service engineering, service level agreement design, provisioning and monitoring. QoS parameters at both application and infrastructure levels are given specific attention as the basis for provisioning policies in the context of temporal constraints.

,Autonomic SLA-Driven Provisioning for Cloud Applications,"Significant achievements have been made for automated allocation of cloud resources. However, the performance of applications may be poor in peak load periods, unless their cloud resources are dynamically adjusted. Moreover, although cloud resources dedicated to different applications are virtually isolated, performance fluctuations do occur because of resource sharing, and software or hardware failures (e.g. unstable virtual machines, power outages, etc.). In this paper, we propose a decentralized economic approach for dynamically adapting the cloud resources of various applications, so as to statistically meet their SLA performance and availability goals in the presence of varying loads or failures. According to our approach, the dynamic economic fitness of a Web service determines whether it is replicated or migrated to another server, or deleted.

,Automatic services instantiation based on a process specification,"A relevant challenge for cloud computing is related to quality control of provided services. Normally, cloud providers deliver services, but do not clearly guarantee their quality level. In addition, each provider uses a particular process to provide service, considering only its own business goals. This paper presents an approach based in an environment model for clouds and aims to propose a solution for these cloud challenges. It intends to define a service procurement process taking into account users requirements, and also considers service quality maintenance. This process uses an environment model containing all relevant information to create a virtual workspace (from just an individual virtualized platform to platforms hosted in clouds), considering hardware and software requirements and quality parameters, all of which are specified by users, to precisely offer the expected service. From this model, it will be possible to automatically provide infrastructure and platform as a service.

,Automatic generation of platforms in cloud computing,"Cloud computing has been established in recent years as an important area of research. This reality has been consolidated because, currently, tasks such as obtainment, manipulation, sharing and exploitation of large amounts of data are common and require many computational resources, so cloud computing can contribute because it can provide this resources indefinitely, including processing, memory, storage and others, all them for immediate use. Cloud computing has many challenges, among them, the specification of work platforms in a cloud environment. In this context, the use of models can help insofar as they may contain several types of information that can be handled with the intention of automating the process of creation of an environment. A template can contain information about the user, hardware and software that can be used by computer systems to automatically build the necessary infrastructure for the operation of a virtual machine on a cloud computing environment. In addition, models can be easily exported to other formats used by cloud services providers. The use of concepts of Service Level Agreements - SLA to control the utilization of computational resources of a provider is common in computing environments and can be used to ensure the quality of services that being offered. The objective of this work is to combine these paradigms, cloud, models and SLA, in order to use the resources of a computational cloud to provide automatically a platform as a service - PaaS. This project will be developed in a web environment, using a model-driven approach to create the platforms and the management of resources and quality will be made by SLA.",,2012,"Borges, H.

,Energy-efficient and SLA-aware management of IaaS clouds,"Cloud computing utilizes arbitrary mega-scale computing infrastructures and is currently revolutionizing the ICT landscape by allowing remote access to computing power and data over the Internet. Besides the huge economical impact Cloud technology exhibits a high potential to be a cornerstone of a new generation of sustainable and energy-efficient ICT. The challenging issue thereby is the energy-efficient utilization of physical machines (PMs) and the resource-efficient management of virtual machines (VMs) while attaining promised non-functional qualities of service expressed by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Currently, there exist solutions for PM power management, VM migrations, and dynamic reconfiguration of VMs. However, most of the existing approaches consider each of them alone, and only use rudimentary concepts for migration costs or disrespect the nature of the highly volatile workloads. In this paper we present an integrated approach for VM migration and reconfiguration, and PM power management. Thereby, we incorporate an autonomic management loop, where proactive actions are suggested for all three areas in a hierarchically structured way. We evaluate our approach with both, synthetic workload data and real-word monitoring data of a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) application used for the protein folding in the bioinformatics area. The efficacy of our approach is evaluated by considering classical algorithms like First Fit, Monte Carlo and Vector Packing, adapted for energy-efficient reallocation.

,Leveraging Smart-Meters for Initiating Application Migration across Clouds for Performance and Power-Expenditure Trade-Offs,"Smart meters, introduced by smart grid technologies, enable power distribution companies to price electricity differently for different times of the day. Such dynamic pricing schemes help the power companies to modulate the aggregate demand of electricity based on the supply. Accordingly, cloud providers, which are often the largest consumers of electricity, should be able to respond to various dynamic pricing signals called demand response (DR) signals by autonomously moving identified applications to other cloud sites. This paper leverages the recent advancements in cloud migration technologies to 'intelligently' move applications across geographically distributed cloud sites at runtime after a DR signal is received by the cloud provider. This helps minimize the cost incurred by a cloud provider and yet provide adequate service level guarantees as stated in the service level agreements (SLA). The current work develops models and solution schemes for identifying suitable applications for migration and placing such applications on remote cloud sites to take advantages of pricing schemes such as the time-of-use pricing and real time pricing.",,2010,"Bose, Sumit Kumar; Salsburg, Michael A. & Mithani, Mohammad Firoj",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5622025,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Reducing Energy Consumption by Using Clouds,"Cloud computing is a promising technology for the realization of large, scalable, and on-demand provisioned computing infrastructures. Currently, many enterprises are adopting Clouds to achieve high performance and scalability for their applications while maintaining low costs. Service provisioning in the Cloud is based on a set of predefined nonfunctional properties specified and negotiated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). Cloud workloads are dynamic and change constantly. Thus, in order to reduce steady human interactions, self-manageable Cloud techniques are required to comply with the agreed customers' SLAs. Flexible and reliable management of SLAs is of paramount importance for both, Cloud providers and consumers. On one hand, the prevention of SLA violations avoids penalties that are costly to providers. On the other hand, based on flexible and timely reactions to possible SLA violation threats, user interaction with the system can be minimized enabling Cloud computing to take roots as a flexible and reliable form of on-demand computing. Furthermore, a trade-off has to be found between proactive actions that prevent SLA violations and those that reduce energy consumption, i.e., increase energy efficiency. In this talk we discuss how the application of Cloud computing technologies can support the work of scientists working in the field of high-throughput sequencing, while at the same time optimizing utilization of resource and increasing energy efficiency.",,2013,"Brandic, Ivona",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2624948.2624990 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6821122,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

However, identification of sources responsible for the possible SLA violation and the decision about the reactive actions necessary to prevent SLA violation is far from trivial.

Second, we devise a layered Cloud architecture for the bottom-up propagation of failures to the layer, which can react to sensed SLA violation threats.

First, we define a typical SLA use case and formulate the expected behavior of the knowledge management system in order to prevent possible SLA violations. Second, we investigate different methods for knowledge management, e.g., situation calculus and case based reasoning (CBR). We discuss how these methods match the expected behavior for SLA violation prevention. In particular we examine the CBR method and devise several approaches for knowledge management in Clouds based on CBR.

,Models and Guidelines for Dimensioning Private Clouds,"It is a real challenge for cloud providers to offer cloud resources that are 'virtually unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time' in a cost-effective way. In this paper, we propose quantitative models that enable cloud providers to make an informed trade-off between cost and quality. Distinguishing between public and private cloud environments we consider infinite and finite source models respectively. In both cases either homogeneous or heterogeneous cloud resource requests are considered. These models can be applied to cloud dimensioning based on request blocking probability, an important SLA parameter. We derive a novel, insightful method that makes it possible to compute resource requirements in private clouds with heterogeneous resource requests.

,Improving consolidation of virtual machines with risk-aware bandwidth oversubscription in compute clouds,"Current trends in virtualization, green computing, and cloud computing require ever increasing efficiency in consolidating virtual machines without degrading quality of service. In this work, we consider consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers (e.g., hosts or racks) in a cloud where the physical network (e.g., network interface or top of the rack switch link) may become a bottleneck. Since virtual machines do not simultaneously use maximum of their nominal bandwidth, the capacity of the physical container can be multiplexed. We assume that each virtual machine has a probabilistic guarantee on realizing its bandwidth Requirements-as derived from its Service Level Agreement with the cloud provider. Therefore, the problem of consolidating virtual machines on the minimum number of physical containers, while preserving these bandwidth allocation guarantees, can be modeled as a Stochastic Bin Packing (SBP) problem, where each virtual machine's bandwidth demand is treated as a random variable. We consider both offline and online versions of SBP. Under the assumption that the virtual machines' bandwidth consumption obeys normal distribution, we show a 2-approximation algorithm for the offline version and improve the previously reported results by presenting a (2 +∈)-competitive algorithm for the online version. We also observe that a dual polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for SBP can be obtained via reduction to the two-dimensional vector bin packing problem. Finally, we perform a thorough performance evaluation study using both synthetic and real data to evaluate the behavior of our proposed algorithms, showing their practical applicability.",,2012,"Breitgand, David & Epstein, Amir",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6195716,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SLA-aware placement of multi-virtual machine elastic services in compute clouds,"Elastic services comprise multiple virtualized resources that can be added and deleted on demand to match variability in the workload. A Service owner profiles the service to determine its most appropriate sizing under different workload conditions. This variable sizing is formalized through a service level agreement (SLA) between the service owner and the cloud provider. The Cloud provider obtains maximum benefit when it succeeds to fully allocate the resource set demanded by the elastic service subject to its SLA. Failure to do so may result in SLA breach and financial losses to the provider. We define a novel combinatorial optimization problem called elastic services placement problem (ESPP) to maximize the provider's benefit from SLA compliant placement. We observe that ESPP extends the generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is a well studied combinatorial optimization problem. However, ESPP turns out to be considerably harder to solve as it does not admit a constant factor approximation. We show that using a simple transformation, ESPP can be presented as a multi-unit combinatorial auction. We further present a column generation method to obtain near optimal solutions for ESPP for large data centers where exact solutions cannot be obtained in a reasonable amount of time using a direct integer programming formulation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through an extensive simulation study. Our results show that we are capable of consistently obtaining good solutions in a time efficient manner. Moreover, if one is willing to trade precision to gain in computation time, our method allows to explicitly manage this tradeoff.",,2011,"Breitgand, David & Epstein, Amir",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5990687,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Creating standardized products for electronic markets,"Cloud computing is supposed to offer resources (i.e., data, software, and hardware services) in a manner similar to traditional utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. However, the current Cloud market is fragmented and static, preventing the successful implementation of ubiquitous computing on demand. In order to address the issue of fragmentation, commodity Cloud marketplaces have been suggested. However, as those marketplaces still suffer from being static (i.e., not being capable to adapt to changing market conditions and to the dynamics of user requirements for services), they do not operate at the optimal point. In this paper, we address this issue by channeling demand and supply into a few standardized services that are automatically adapted to user requirements in regular time intervals. For this, we utilize clustering algorithms and monitor the requirements of users. In order to avoid any cost to the user through these adaptations, we automatically adapt service level specifications of users to newly defined standardized goods.

In this paper, we focus on answering how many standardized services should be placed in the market. This work is based on a new definition of liquidity for cloud resources, which in turn has been derived from liquidity definitions of financial markets. Using a simulation framework, we evaluate our method for estimating the optimal quantity of standardized services with respect to market liquidity and demonstrate the benefits of this approach in terms of increase in market efficiency and decrease in users' cost of participation in the market.

,Cost-Efficient Utilization of Public SLA Templates in Autonomic Cloud Markets,"Dynamic and self-adaptable markets are fundamental for the successful implementation of the Cloud computing paradigm where computing resources are provided on demand and dynamically to the heterogeneous user base. Usually, in Cloud markets, contracts between traders are established using Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which include objectives of service usage. However, Cloud markets face challenges, which are usually not evident in other market types, such as non-standardized goods and large variety of resource types offered on the market, resulting in low number of matches of consumers' bids and providers' asks. Moreover, existing Cloud market mechanisms are usually static and cannot react on dynamic change of user requirements. To counteract these problems, we propose an adaptive approach for autonomically deriving public SLA templates (i.e., templates for generation of electronic contracts) based on user requirements. Although this approach brings many benefits, it also incurs cost to users, since they must adapt specifications of their requirements in order to match automatically generated public SLA templates. In this paper, we reduce this cost by autonomically modifying specifications of user requirements. We introduce a method for adapting public SLA templates not only in respect to definitions of SLA attributes, but also to attribute values. Based on an appropriate utility and cost model, we evaluate the approach and show that it significantly improves the performance of the adaptive SLA template technique.",,2011,"Breskovic, Ivan; Maurer, Michael; Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Brandic, Ivona; Dustdar, Schahram & Maurer, Ivan Breskovic Michael",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.227.4681 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2120969.2121741 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6123502,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Model-free Learning Approach for Coordinated Configuration of Virtual Machines and Appliances,"Cloud computing has a key requirement for resource configuration in a real-time manner. In such virtualized environments, both virtual machines (VMs) and hosted applications need to be configured on-the-fly to adapt to system dynamics. The interplay between the layers of VMs and applications further complicates the problem of cloud configuration. Independent tuning of each aspect may not lead to optimal system wide performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, namely CoTuner, for coordinated configuration of VMs and resident applications. At the heart of the framework is a model-free hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which combines the advantages of Simplex and RL methods and is further enhanced by the use of system knowledge guided exploration policies. Experimental results on Xen-based virtualized environments with TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that CoTuner is able to drive a virtual server system into an optimal or near optimal configuration state dynamically, in response to the change of workload. It improves the systems throughput by more than 30\% over independent tuning strategies. In comparison with the coordinated tuning strategies based solely on Simplex or basic RL algorithm, the hybrid RL algorithm gains 30\% to 40\% throughput improvement.

End users are concerned about their data and how it will be stored in cloud and how the data is recovered in the case of failure of disaster.

,"
Market-oriented cloud computing: vision, hype, and reality of delivering computing as the 5th utility","Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are commoditised and delivered in a manner similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted. Several computing paradigms have promised to deliver this utility computing vision and they include Grid computing, P2P computing, and more recently Cloud computing. The latter term denotes the infrastructure as a ""Cloud"" in which businesses and users are able to access applications from anywhere in the world on demand. Cloud computing delivers infrastructure, platform, and software (application) as services, which are made available as subscription-based services in a pay-as-you-go model to consumers. These services in industry are respectively referred to as Infrastructure as a Service (Iaas), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). To realize Cloud computing, vendors such as Amazon, HP, IBM, and Sun are starting to create and deploy Clouds in various locations around the world. In addition, companies with global operations require faster response time, and thus save time by distributing workload requests to multiple Clouds in various locations at the same time. This creates the need for establishing a computing atmosphere for dynamically interconnecting and provisioning Clouds from multiple domains within and across enterprises. There are many challenges involved in creating such Clouds and Cloud interconnections. This keynote talk (1) presents the 21st century vision of computing and identifies various IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (2) defines the architecture for creating market-oriented Clouds and computing atmosphere by leveraging technologies such as VMs; (3) provides thoughts on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk man- gement to sustain SLA-oriented resource allocation; (4) presents the work carried out as part of our recent initiative in cloud computing, called as Megha: (i) Aneka, a software system for providing PaaS within private or public Clouds and supporting market-oriented resource management, (ii) internetworking of Clouds for dynamic creation of federated computing environments for scaling of elastic applications, (iii) creation of 3rd party Cloud brokering services for content delivery network and e-Science applications and their deployment on capabilities of IaaS providers such as Amazon and Nirvanix along with Grid mashups, and (iv) CloudSim supporting modelling and simulation of Clouds for performance studies; and (5) concludes with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms for delivering our 21st century vision along with pathways for future research.",,2009,"Buyya, R.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5329110,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Market-Oriented Grid Computing and the Gridbus Middleware,"Grid computing, one of the latest buzzwords in the ICT industry, is emerging as a new paradigm for Internet-based parallel and distributing computing. Despite a number of advances in grid computing, resource management and application scheduling in such environments continues to be a challenging and complex undertaking. This is due to geographic distribution of grid resources owned by different organizations with different usage policies, cost models and varying load and availability patterns with time. This tutorial introduces fundamental principles of grid computing and computational economy and discusses how they impact on emerging computational and data grid technologies. It identifies resource management challenges and introduces new challenges and requirements introduced by the grid economy on grid service providers (GSPs) and grid service consumers. The tutorial presents a service-oriented grid architecture inspired by computational economies and demonstrates how it can be realized by leveraging the existing grid technologies and building new economic-oriented capabilities and components. We present solutions to these challenges based on our experience in designing and developing market-oriented Gridbus technologies such as Grid Market Directory, Grid Bank, Grid Service Broker, Workflow Engine, and SLA-based enterprise Grid Resource Allocation system. Case studies on the use of Gridbus middleware in the creation of various e-science and e-business applications and their deployment on national/international utility-oriented grids along with its impact on emerging cloud computing paradigm will also be highlighted.",,2008,"Buyya, Rajkumar",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4760415,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,"SLA-oriented resource provisioning for cloud computing: Challenges, architecture, and solutions","Cloud computing systems promise to offer subscription-oriented, enterprise-quality computing services to users worldwide. With the increased demand for delivering services to a large number of users, they need to offer differentiated services to users and meet their quality expectations. Existing resource management systems in data centers are yet to support Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation, and thus need to be enhanced to realize cloud computing and utility computing. In addition, no work has been done to collectively incorporate customer-driven service management, computational risk management, and autonomic resource management into a market-based resource management system to target the rapidly changing enterprise requirements of Cloud computing. This paper presents vision, challenges, and architectural elements of SLA-oriented resource management.

,"Cloud computing and emerging IT platforms: Vision, hype, and reality for delivering computing as the 5th utility","With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing ‘Storage Clouds’ for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.",,2009,"Buyya, Rajkumar; Yeo, Chee Shin; Venugopal, Srikumar; Broberg, James & Brandic, Ivona",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X08001957 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1528937.1529211,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

,SLA-based management of software licenses as web service resources in distributed computing infrastructures,"Until recently the use of applications requiring a software license for execution was quite limited in distributed environments. Due to the mandatory centralised control of license usage at application runtime, e.g. heartbeat control by the license server running at the home site of a user, traditional software licensing practices are not suitable especially when the distributed computing infrastructure stretches across administrative domains. In this paper we present a novel approach for managing software licenses as web service resources in distributed service oriented environments. Licenses become mobile objects, which may travel to the environment where required to authorise the execution of a license protected application. A first implementation has been realised for dynamic Grid environments in the European SmartLM project co-funded by the European Commission. The SmartLM solution decouples authorisation for license usage from authorisation for application execution. All authorisations are expressed as and guaranteed by Service Level Agreements. We will present the core technology, discuss various security aspects and how they are addressed in the SmartLM prototype, and present the evaluation of the prototype through a number of usage scenarios. Finally, we will give an outlook on specific issues and current work extending the solution to Clouds and service based systems in general.",,2012,"Cacciari, Claudio; Mallmann, Daniel; Zsigri, Csilla; D’Andria, Francesco; Hagemeier, Bj\""{o}rn; Rumpl, Angela; Ziegler, Wolfgang & Martrat, Josep",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X11002287,,SLA and Cloud
,Intelligent power- and performance-aware tradeoffs for multicore servers in cloud data centers,Cloud service providers are seeking new solutions for reducing the energy consumption in their data centers. Our work in developing middleware that is integrated with a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to lower the energy consumption while maximizing the performance of or minimizing the service level agreement (SLA) violations for applications. To that end our solution leverages techniques such as Dynamic voltage/frequency scaling (DVFS) and server consolidation through live migration of virtual machines from an overloaded host machine to a less-loaded one.,,2013,"Caglar, Faruk; Shekhar, Shashank; An, Kyoungho; Gokhale, Aniruddha & Kyoungho An",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2502524.2502559,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud
,A coordinator for scaling elastic applications across multiple clouds,"Cloud computing allows customers to dynamically scale their applications, software platforms, and hardware infrastructures according to negotiated Service Level Agreements (SLAs). However, resources available in a single Cloud data center are limited, thus if a large demand for an elastic application is observed in a given time, a Cloud provider will not be able to deliver uniform Quality of Service (QoS) to handle such a demand and SLAs may be violated. One approach that can be taken to avoid such a scenario is enabling further growing of the application by scaling it across multiple, independent Cloud data centers, following market-based trading and negotiation of resources. This approach, as envisioned in the InterCloud project, is realized by agents called Cloud Coordinators and allows for an increase in performance, reliability, and scalability of elastic applications. In this paper, we propose both an architecture for such Cloud Coordinator and an extensible design that allows its adoption in different public and private Clouds. An evaluation of the Cloud Coordinator prototype running in a small-scale scenario shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its impact on elastic applications.",,2012,"Calheiros, Rodrigo N.; Toosi, Adel Nadjaran; Vecchiola, Christian & Buyya, Rajkumar",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X12000635,,SLA and Cloud
,Energy-Aware Workflow Job Scheduling for Green Clouds,"With the increasing deployment of many data centers and computer servers around the globe, the energy cost on running the computing, communication and cooling together with the amount of CO2 emissions have increased dramatically. In order to maintain sustainable Cloud computing with ever-increasing problem scale, we design and develop energy-aware scientific workflow scheduling algorithm to minimize energy consumption and CO2 emission without sacrificing Quality of Service (QoS) such as response time specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA). The underlying available computing capacity and network bandwidth is represented as time-dependent because of the dual operation modes of on-demand and reservation instances supported by many commercial Cloud data centers. The Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is utilized to lower the CPU frequencies of virtual machines as long as the finishing time is still before the specified deadline. Our resource provision and allocation algorithm aims to meet the response time requirement and minimize the Virtual Machine (VM) overhead for reduced energy consumption. The consolidated VM reuse can lead to higher resource utilization rate for higher system throughput. The effectiveness of our algorithm is evaluated under various performance metrics and experimental scenarios using software adapted from open source CloudSim simulator. The simulation results show that our algorithm is able to achieve an average up to 30\% of energy savings.",,2013,"Cao, Fei & Zhu, Michelle M.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6682072 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2548018.2548193,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Energy-Efficient Resource Management for Scientific Workflows in Clouds,"The elastic resource provision, non-interfering resource sharing and flexible customized configuration provided by the Cloud infrastructure has shed light on efficient execution of many scientific applications. Due to the increasing deployment of data centers and computer servers around the globe escalated by the higher electricity price, the energy cost on running the computing, communication and cooling together with the amount of CO2 emissions have skyrocketed. In order to maintain sustainable Cloud computing facing with ever-increasing problem complexity and big data size in the next decades, we design and develop energy-aware scientific workflow scheduling algorithm to minimize energy consumption and CO2 emission while still satisfying certain Quality of Service (QoS) such as response time specified in Service Level Agreement (SLA). We also apply Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) and DNS scheme to further reduce energy consumption within acceptable performance bounds. Our multiple-step resource provision and allocation algorithm achieves the response time requirement in the step of forwarding task scheduling and minimizes the VM overhead for reduced energy consumption and higher resource utilization rate in the backward task scheduling step.

,Optimal Multiserver Configuration for Profit Maximization in Cloud Computing,"As cloud computing becomes more and more popular, understanding the economics of cloud computing becomes critically important. To maximize the profit, a service provider should understand both service charges and business costs, and how they are determined by the characteristics of the applications and the configuration of a multiserver system. The problem of optimal multiserver configuration for profit maximization in a cloud computing environment is studied. Our pricing model takes such factors into considerations as the amount of a service, the workload of an application environment, the configuration of a multiserver system, the service-level agreement, the satisfaction of a consumer, the quality of a service, the penalty of a low-quality service, the cost of renting, the cost of energy consumption, and a service provider's margin and profit. Our approach is to treat a multiserver system as an M/M/m queuing model, such that our optimization problem can be formulated and solved analytically. Two server speed and power consumption models are considered, namely, the idle-speed model and the constant-speed model. The probability density function of the waiting time of a newly arrived service request is derived. The expected service charge to a service request is calculated. The expected net business gain in one unit of time is obtained. Numerical calculations of the optimal server size and the optimal server speed are demonstrated.",,2013,"Cao, Junwei; Member, Senior; Hwang, Kai; Li, Keqin & Zomaya, Albert Y.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2498735.2498818 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6226389 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.338.1400,IEEE Press,SLA and Cloud
,Energy-Aware Framework for Virtual Machine Consolidation in Cloud Computing,"Virtual machine (VM) consolidation in Cloud computing environments provides a great opportunity for energy saving. However, the obligation of providing suitable quality of service to end users leads to the necessity in dealing with energy-performance tradeoff. In this paper, we propose a redesigned energy-aware heuristic framework for VM consolidation to achieve a better energy-performance tradeoff. The main contribution of us is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation decision algorithm, which is used to decide a host is overload with SLA violation or not. Finally, we have evaluated our framework through simulation on large-scale experiments driven by workload traces from more than a thousand VMs, and the results show that our framework outperforms previous work, which has 11.8\%\~{}27\% decrease in energy consumption, 57.9\%\~{}78.4\% decrease in SLA violation, 63.2\%\~{}84.1\% decrease in energy-performance metric which is a product metric of the energy consumption and SLA violation.",,2013,"Cao, Zhibo & Dong, Shoubin",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6832154 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2644152.2644208,Kluwer Academic Publishers,SLA and Cloud
,Dynamic VM Consolidation for Energy-Aware and SLA Violation Reduction in Cloud Computing,"With the large-scale deployment of virtualized data centers, energy consumption and SLA (Service Level Agreement) violation have already become the urgent issue to be solved. And it is essential and important to design energy-aware allocation policy for energy-aware and SLA violation reduction. In this paper, we propose a novel allocation and selection policy for the dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation in virtualized data centers to reduce energy consumption and SLA violation. Firstly, we use the mean and standard deviation of CPU utilization for VM to determine the hosts overloaded or not, secondly we use the positive maximum correlation coefficient to select VMs from those overloading hosts for migration.

In this paper, we formulate the ASP resource management as an optimization problem and propose both reactive and proactive heuristic policies that approximate the optimal solution.

This paper analyzes the problem from the perspective of an Application Service Provider (ASP) that uses a cloud infrastructure to achieve scalable provisioning of its services in the respect of QoS constraints. First we draw a taxonomy of IaaS provider and use the identified features to drive the design of four autonomic service management architectures differing on the degree of control an ASP have on the system. We implemented two of this solutions and related mechanism to test five different resource provisioning policies. The implemented testbed has been evaluated under a realistic workload based on Wikipedia access traces on Amazon EC2 platform. The experimental evaluation performed confirms that: the proposed policies are capable to properly dimension the system resources making the whole system self-adaptable respect to the workload fluctuation.

From this model we define an optimization problem allowing to determine the optimal distribution of the incoming load and the proper allocation of outsourced resources that satisfies the SLAs and that minimizes the outsourcing costs, thus allowing the maximization of the SP revenue.

Being offered as a Service, any user can negotiate with the provider his desired requirements in terms of operational parameters and non-functional features (i.e. security, dependability, etc).

Due to the dynamic nature of cloud the matching of SLA templates need to be dynamic and continuous monitoring of Quality of Service (QoS) is necessary to enforce SLAs.

,IaaS Cloud Security,"In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business concept to one of the fastest growing segments of the IT industry. Now, recession-hit companies are increasingly realizing that simply by tapping into the cloud they can gain fast access to best-of-breed business applications or drastically boost their infrastructure resources, all at negligible cost. Securing our digital assets has become increasingly challenging as our reliance on rapidly evolving technologies continues to grow. The security perimeter in computing has changed from a well-defined boundary that was relatively easy to identify and defend, to an elastic boundary that is constantly changing and for which the threats are constantly evolving. This paper investigates the complex security challenges that are introduced by the trend towards Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)-based cloud computing. Availability, Authenticity, and Privacy are essential concerns for both Cloud providers and consumers as well. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) serves as the foundation layer for the other delivery models, and a lack of security in this layer will certainly affect the other delivery models, i.e., PaaS, and SaaS that are built upon IaaS layer. This paper presents an elaborated study of IaaS components' security and determines vulnerabilities and countermeasures. Finally, as a result of this research, we propose a Security Model for IaaS (SMI) to guide security assessment and enhancement in IaaS layer.",,2013,"Chavan, Pragati; Patil, Pradeep; Kulkarni, Gurudatt; Sutar, Ramesh & Belsare, Shrikant",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6918892,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

It is necessary to explore a method to gain the prospective stable system status by accurate and well adapted analysis of the performance of the cloud center system. This paper proposes an analysis framework to evaluate comprehensive performance guideline of cloud computing center. Our analysis framework is built based on the performance agent and server interface method (PASI), which consists of PMC, PMA and PMS (CAS), and put forward a mathematical model based on queuing theory to demonstrate the feasibility of this method.

,Consolidating complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness in cloud datacenters,"In cloud datacenters, effective resource provisioning is needed to maximize energy efficiency and utilization of cloud resources while guaranteeing the Service Level Agreement (SLA) for tenants. Previous resource provisioning strategies either allocate physical resources to virtual machines (VMs) based on static VM resource demands or dynamically handle the variations in VM resource requirements through live VM migrations. However, the former fail to maximize energy efficiency and resource utilization while the latter produce high migration overhead. To handle these problems, we propose an initial VM allocation mechanism that consolidates complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness. Complementary VMs are the VMs whose total demand of each resource dimension (in the spatial space) nearly reaches their host's capacity during VM lifetime period (in the temporal space). Based on our observation of the existence of VM resource utilization patterns, the mechanism predicts the lifetime resource utilization patterns of short-term VMs or periodical resource utilization patterns of long-term VMs. Based on the predicted patterns, it coordinates the requirements of different resources and consolidates complementary VMs in the same physical machine (PM). This mechanism reduces the number of PMs needed to provide VM service hence increases energy efficiency and resource utilization and also reduces the number of VM migrations and SLA violations. Simulation based on two real traces and real-world testbed experiments show that our initial VM allocation mechanism significantly reduces the number of PMs used, SLA violations and VM migrations of the previous resource provisioning strategies.",,2014,"Chen, Liuhua & Shen, Haiying",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6848033,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Characterizing web application performance for maximizing service providers' profits in clouds,"A number of challenges in implementing cloud technique related to further improving Web application performance and decreasing the cost. In order to achieve high profits, cloud-based web application providers must carefully balance cloud resources and dynamic workloads. However, this task is usually difficulty because of the complex nature of most web application. In this paper, we presented a predictive performance model to analyze such applications and to determine when and how much resource to allocate to each tier of an application. In addition, we proposed a new profit model to describe revenues specified by the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and costs generated by leased resources. Furthermore, we employed profit driven model to guide our resource management algorithms to maximize the profits earned to the service providers. We also designed and implemented a simulation experiment on CloudSim that adopts our proposed methodology. Experimental results indicated that our model faithfully captures the performance and resources are allocated properly in response to the changing workload, thus the goal of maximizing the profit has been achieved.",,2011,"Chen, Xi; Chen, Haopeng; Zheng, Qing; Wang, Wenting & Liu, Guodong",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2354417.2355553 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6138519,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Adaptive AutoSLAM - Policy-Based Orchestration of SLA Establishment,"Service Level Agreement (SLA) establishment can be viewed as a cross-organizational business process, in which consumers and providers, with varying and potentially conflicting requirements and capabilities, interact with one another in order to try and reach common agreements over the service usage terms and conditions. These interactions are governed by public interaction protocols which define their communicative behaviour, and are guided by private decision making strategies which define their strategic behaviour. In this paper, we propose a novel policy-based approach for orchestrating SLA establishment that enables a loose, run-time coupling between these two behaviours, resulting in a more flexible and adaptive automated SLA establishment process. We have implemented our approach by extending the AutoSLAM middleware [2][3][4] and validated it through a real-world use case scenario of procuring computing resources from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).",,2014,"Chhetri, Mohan Baruwal; Vo, Quoc Bao & Kowalczyk, Ryszard",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6930569 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2680847.2681456,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A SLA-based dynamically integrating services SaaS framework,"SaaS cloud computing is gaining momentum in recent years with more and more successful application adoptions. Processes of these applications often comprise a series of services mapping to users' work flows and a consumer has to designate a particular provider for each service when deploying an application. As long as the provider fails to deliver the service, all application processes which include the service will discontinue their execution even though some other providers may offer the same service. In this paper, we propose a SaaS framework to support dynamic service composition based on QoS criteria of SLA. Each service is brokered and delivered to best fit the criteria specified when it is requested. Applications running on this framework will therefore obtain optimal performance.",,2010,Chia-Hsien Wen; Hei-Ru Shiau; Chen-Yen Wang & Szu-Yen Wang,http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/conferences/10.1049/cp.2010.0579,IET,SLA and Cloud

The management center in our cloud model focuses on the optimal service rate and buffer size control.

,An Optimal Cost-Efficient Resource Provisioning for Multi-servers Cloud Computing,"Recently, the emergence of the cloud computing offers innovative services models to share computing resources through the internet. However, with the ever increasing in operating costs, resources management becomes the major concerns for cloud providers. In this paper, two scheduling policies are presented to stay away from the risk of over-provisioning and under-provisioning in both quantity of servers and service rate. A cloud server farm is model as an M/M/R queuing model, such that system congestion cost and balking event loss can be estimated analytically. A cost function is developed by taking system operating cost, working mode cost, system congestion cost, etc. into consideration. Two heuristic algorithms are presented to address the problem of finding optimal solutions. Simulation results show that the optimal quantity of servers and service rate can be obtained to minimum cost. As compared to system without adopting our policies, cost reduction and waiting time improvement can be verified under the same SLA constraint in our system.",,2013,"Chiang, Yi-Ju; Ouyang, Yen-Chieh & Hsu, Ching-Hsien",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6820997 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2605701.2623453,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Automation System for Validation of Configuration and Security Compliance in Managed Cloud Services,"Validation of configuration and security compliance at the time of creating new service is an important part of service management process and governance in most IT delivery organizations. It is performed to ensure that security risks, governance controls and vulnerabilities are proactively managed through the lifecycle of the services, and to guarantee that all discovered problems and issues are addressed and remediated for quality assurance before the services are delivered to customers. The validation process is complex and is typically carried out by following a checklist with questions and answers through manual steps that are time consuming and error prone. This lengthy process is particularly troublesome when providing managed cloud services to enterprise customers with a pre-specified request fulfillment time in SLA. In order to improve the timeliness and quality of cloud services, we have introduced an automation system to orchestrate the validation process with executable scripts to be executed against the services. We will describe a novel policy mechanism to capture exception rules for eliminating possible interference in security configuration contained in the scripts. We will explain how our system is designed and implemented to fulfill the needs of large enterprises from both the service provider's and the service consumer's vantage points.",,2012,"Chieu, Trieu C.; Singh, Manas; Tang, Chunqiang; Viswanathan, Mahesh & Gupta, Ashu",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6468252 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2471884.2473004,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Dynamic resource allocation using auto-negotiation in Haizea,"Higher hardware utilization and SLA fulfillment are two main objectives of any infrastructure cloud, thus, making resource allocation to virtual machines as one of the most critical aspect. Haizea is a popular cloud lease manager which supports a variety of resource leases according to the application requirements. These leases are: Immediate, Best-Effort, Deadline Sensitive and Advance Reservation (AR). But all these leases are static in nature viz. once resources are allocated to a lease, these resources cannot be altered during the complete lifetime of the lease. This contradicts with the philosophy and implementation of a pure on-demand elastic cloud where resources of a lease are continuously monitored against the utilization and altered based on the requirements. Our work aims at the inclusion of three important features to mitigate this shortcoming in Haizea. First, it introduces a new class of lease: Dynamic lease to accommodate resource changes. Second, it examines virtual machine resource utilization to decide about the demand and need of allocation change and third, it accommodates the expected changes in resource allocation by introducing two new sub-leases which allow dynamic resource allocation in the schedule. Lease experiments are performed on Haizea to validate the introduced features.",,2013,"Chokhani, Pratick & Somani, Gaurav",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6612196,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An SLA-aware load balancing scheme for cloud datacenters,"One of the most important issues about cloud computing is how to achieve load balancing among thousands of virtual machines (VMs) in a large datacenter. In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized load balancing architecture, called tldlb (two-level decentralized load balancer). This distributed load balancer takes advantage of the decentralized architecture for providing scalability and high availability capabilities to service more cloud users. We also propose a neural network-based dynamic load balancing algorithm, called nn-dwrr (neural network-based dynamic weighted round-robin), to dispatch a large number of requests to different VMs, which are actually providing services. In nn-dwrr, we combine VM load metrics (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and disk I/O utilizations) monitoring and neural network-based load prediction to adjust the weight of each VM. Experimental results support that our proposed load balancing algorithm, nn-dwrr, can be applied to a large cloud datacenter, and it is 1.86 times faster than the wrr, 1.49 times faster than the Capacity-based, and 1.21 times faster than the ANN-based load balancing algorithms in terms of average response time. In addition, tldlb can reduce the SLA (service-level agreement) violation rate via in-time activating VMs from a spare VM pool.",,2014,Chung-Cheng Li & Kuochen Wang,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6799665,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Cost-Efficient and Application SLA-Aware Client Side Request Scheduling in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service Cloud,"Providers of applications deployed in an Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud permanently face the decision of whether it is more cost-efficient to scale up(i.e., rent more resources from the cloud) or to delay incoming requests, even though doing so may lead to dissatisfied customers and broken service level agreements. This decision is further complicated by the fact that not all customers have the same agreements, and not all requests require the same amount of resources devoted to them. In this paper, we present an approach for optimally scheduling incoming requests to virtual computing resources in the cloud, so that the sum of payments for resources and loss incurred by service level agreement violations is minimized. We discuss our approach based on an illustrative use case.

Performance in cloud computing is defined through Service Level Agreement contracts between the cloud provider and cloud customer, being a projection of the customer's perspective on the service offered by the cloud provider. Although more and more research efforts go into standardizing Service Level Agreement in cloud systems, the area is still at its early ages. This paper proposes a Service Level Agreement negotiation protocol based on particle swarm optimization techniques, for obtaining a balance between the energy consumed and performance offered in the cloud.

,VM consolidation: A real case based on OpenStack Cloud,"In recent years, Cloud computing has been emerging as the next big revolution in both computer networks and Web provisioning. Because of raised expectations, several vendors, such as Amazon and IBM, started designing, developing, and deploying Cloud solutions to optimize the usage of their own data centers, and some open-source solutions are also underway, such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack. Cloud architectures exploit virtualization techniques to provision multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on the same physical host, so as to efficiently use available resources, for instance, to consolidate VMs in the minimal number of physical servers to reduce the runtime power consumption. VM consolidation has to carefully consider the aggregated resource consumption of co-located VMs, in order to avoid performance reductions and Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. While various works have already treated the VM consolidation problem from a theoretical perspective, this paper focuses on it from a more practical viewpoint, with specific attention on the consolidation aspects related to power, CPU, and networking resource sharing. Moreover, the paper proposes a Cloud management platform to optimize VM consolidation along three main dimensions, namely power consumption, host resources, and networking. Reported experimental results point out that interferences between co-located VMs have to be carefully considered to avoid placement solutions that, although being feasible from a more theoretical viewpoint, cannot ensure VM provisioning with SLA guarantees.",,2014,"Corradi, Antonio; Fanelli, Mario & Foschini, Luca",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2565361.2565426 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X12001082,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

,Adaptive Query Processing in Cloud Database Systems,"In cloud environments, resources should be acquired and released automatically and quickly at runtime. Thereby, the implementation of traditional query optimization strategies in cloud platforms can have a poor performance, because they cannot predict future availability and/or release of resources. In such scenarios, adaptive query processing can adapt itself to the available resources to run queries and, consequently, present an acceptable performance in response to a query. However, traditional and adaptive query optimizers main objective is to reduce response time. Moreover, in the context of cloud computing, users and providers of services expect to get answers in time to guarantee the SLA. Therefore, we propose a framework that uses adaptive query processing based on heuristic rules and cost of failing the SLA.

,A novel approach for scheduling service request in cloud with trust monitor,"Cloud computing serves as the service provider globally connected, which provides service to the cloud users. The processing of the users request plays an important role in the cloud service. In order to achieve low response time of the requested user service, the services are processed as such resulting in low throughput where all the users can't receive their guaranteed service from the cloud provider. The random processing of service as a result, a security issue such as intrusion also occurs. The novel cloud scheduling scheme uses SLA(Service Level Agreement) along with trust monitor to provide a faster scheduling of the over flooding user request with secure processing of the request. The security of the cloud is maintain based on the SLA criteria and trust monitor acts as the third party and monitors whole processing of the services, any illegal action is consider as intrusion and reported to the scheduler and message is sent to the user and provider and further penalties is taken. The schedule gives improved fast schedule time and low rescheduling ratio than grid scheduling.

Since the software and hardware components of cloud infrastructures may have limited reliability, fault tolerance mechanisms are a means of achieving the necessary dependability requirements. This paper investigates the benefits of a warm-standy replication mechanism in a Eucalyptus cloud computing environment. A hierarchical heterogeneous modeling approach is used to represent a redundant architecture and compare its availability to that of a non-redundant architecture. Both hardware and software failures are considered in the proposed analytical models. The results show an enhanced dependability for the proposed redundant system, as well as a decrease in the annual downtime. The results also demonstrate that the simple replacement of hardware by more reliable machines would not produce improvements in system availability to the same extent as would the fault tolerant approach.",,2012,"Dantas, Jamilson; Matos, Rubens; Araujo, Jean & Maciel, Paulo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6377976,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An intelligent approach for virtual machine and QoS provisioning in cloud computing,"Cloud Computing has become the most popular distributed computing environment because it does not require any user level management and controlling on the low-level implementation of the system. However, efficient resource provisioning is a key challenge for cloud computing and resolving such kind of problem can reduce under or over utilization of resources, increase user satisfaction by serving more users during peak hours, reduce implementation cost for providers and service cost for users. Existing works on cloud computing focuses to accurate estimation of the capacity needs, static or dynamic VM (Virtual Machine) creation and scheduling. But significant amount of time is required to create and destroy VMs which could be used to serve more user requests. In this paper, an adaptive QoS (Quality of Service) aware VM provisioning mechanism is developed that ensures efficient utilization of the system resources. The VM for similar type of requests has been recycled so that the VM creation time can be minimized and used to serve more user requests. In the proposed model, QoS is ensured by serving all the tasks within the requirements described in SLA. Tasks are separated using multilevel queue and the most urgent task is given high priority. The simulation-based experimental results shows that a great number of tasks can be served compared to others which will help to satisfy customers during the peak hour.",,2013,"Das, A.

,Compatibility-Aware Cloud Service Composition under Fuzzy Preferences of Users,"When a single Cloud service (i.e., a software image and a virtual machine), on its own, cannot satisfy all the user requirements, a composition of Cloud services is required. Cloud service composition, which includes several tasks such as discovery, compatibility checking, selection, and deployment, is a complex process and users find it difficult to select the best one among the hundreds, if not thousands, of possible compositions available. Service composition in Cloud raises even new challenges caused by diversity of users with different expertise requiring their applications to be deployed across difference geographical locations with distinct legal constraints. The main difficulty lies in selecting a combination of virtual appliances (software images) and infrastructure services that are compatible and satisfy a user with vague preferences. Therefore, we present a framework and algorithms which simplify Cloud service composition for unskilled users. We develop an ontology-based approach to analyze Cloud service compatibility by applying reasoning on the expert knowledge. In addition, to minimize effort of users in expressing their preferences, we apply combination of evolutionary algorithms and fuzzy logic for composition optimization. This lets users express their needs in linguistics terms which brings a great comfort to them compared to systems that force users to assign exact weights for all preferences.",,2014,"Dastjerdi, Amir Vahid & Buyya, Rajkumar",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6714436,,SLA and Cloud

Therefore, our objective is to offer a state-of-the-art solution to automate the negotiation process in Cloud environments. In previous works in the SLA negotiation area, requesters trust whatever QoS criteria values providers offer in the process of negotiation. However, the proposed negotiation strategy for requesters in this work is capable of assessing reliability of offers received from Cloud providers. In addition, our proposed negotiation strategy for Cloud providers considers utilization of resources when it generates new offers during negotiation and concedes more on the price of less utilized resources. The experimental results show that our strategy helps Cloud providers to increase their profits when they are participating in parallel negotiation with multiple requesters.",,2012,"Dastjerdi, Amir Vahid & Buyya, Rajkumar",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217433 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310187,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Security Infrastructure for On-demand Provisioned Cloud Infrastructure Services,"Providing consistent security services in on-demand provisioned Cloud infrastructure services is of primary importance due to multi-tenant and potentially multi-provider nature of Clouds Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) environment. Cloud security infrastructure should address two aspects of the IaaS operation and dynamic security services provisioning: (1) provide security infrastructure for secure Cloud IaaS operation, (2) provisioning dynamic security services, including creation and management of the dynamic security associations, as a part of the provisioned composite services or virtual infrastructures. The first task is a traditional task in security engineering, while dynamic provisioning of managed security services in virtualised environment remains a problem and requires additional research. In this paper we discuss both aspects of the Cloud Security and provide suggestions about required security mechanisms for secure data management in dynamically provisioned Cloud infrastructures. The paper refers to the architectural framework for on-demand infrastructure services provisioning, being developed by authors, that provides a basis for defining the proposed Cloud Security Infrastructure. The proposed SLA management solution is based on the WS-Agreement and allows dynamic SLA management during the whole provisioned services lifecycle. The paper discusses conceptual issues, basic requirements and practical suggestions for dynamically provisioned access control infrastructure (DACI). The paper proposes the security mechanisms that are required for consistent DACI operation, in particular security tokens used for access control, policy enforcement and authorisation session context exchange between provisioned infrastructure services and Cloud provider services. The suggested implementation is based on the GAAA Toolkit Java library developed by authors that is extended with the proposed Common Security Services Interface (CSSI) and additional mechanisms for - inding sessions and security context between provisioned services and virtualised platform.",,2011,"Demchenko, Yuri; Ngo, Canh; de Laat, Cees; Wlodarczyk, Tomasz Wiktor; Rong, Chunming & Ziegler, Wolfgang",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6133151 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2114498.2116217,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Resource Usage Monitoring in Clouds,"Monitoring of infrastructural resources in clouds plays a crucial role in providing application guarantees like performance, availability, and security. Monitoring is crucial from two perspectives - the cloud-user and the service provider. The cloud user's interest is in doing an analysis to arrive at appropriate Service-level agreement (SLA) demands and thecloud provider's interest is to assess if the demand can be met. To support this, a monitoring framework is necessary particularly since cloud hosts are subject to varying load conditions. To illustrate the importance of such a framework, we choose the example of performance being the Quality of Service (QoS) requirement and show how inappropriate provisioning of resources may lead to unexpected performance bottlenecks. We evaluate existing monitoring frameworks to bring out the motivation for buildingmuch more powerful monitoring frameworks. We then propose a distributed monitoring framework, which enables ï¬ne grained monitoring for applications and demonstrate with a prototype system implementation for typical use cases.",,2012,"Dhingra, Mohit; Lakshmi, J. & Nandy, S.

,"Elastic Resources Framework in IaaS, Preserving Performance SLAs","Elasticity in cloud systems provides the flexibility to acquire and relinquish computing resources on demand. However, in current virtualized systems resource allocation is mostly static. Resources are allocated during VM instantiation and any change in workload leading to significant increase or decrease in resources is handled by VM migration. Hence, cloud users tend to characterize their workloads at a coarse grained level which potentially leads to under-utilized VM resources or under performing application. A more flexible and adaptive resource allocation mechanism would benefit variable workloads, such as those characterized by web servers. In this paper, we present an elastic resources framework for IaaS cloud layer that addresses this need. The framework provisions for application workload forecasting engine, that predicts at run-time the expected demand, which is input to the resource manager to modulate resource allocation based on the predicted demand. Based on the prediction errors, resources can be over-allocated or under-allocated as compared to the actual demand made by the application. Over-allocation leads to unused resources and under allocation could cause under performance. To strike a good trade-off between over-allocation and under-performance we derive an excess cost model. In this model excess resources allocated are captured as over-allocation cost and under-allocation is captured as a penalty cost for violating application service level agreement (SLA). Confidence interval for predicted workload is used to minimize this excess cost with minimal effect on SLA violations. An example case-study for an academic institute web server workload is presented. Using the confidence interval to minimize excess cost, we achieve significant reduction in resource allocation requirement while restricting application SLA violations to below 2-3\%.",,2013,"Dhingra, Mohit; Lakshmi, J.; Nandy, S.

The goal of this talk is to overview how search-based optimization techniques have been successfully applied in SOA and how they can contribute in the field of self-adapting systems and cloud architectures. On the one hand, we will overview how the use of search-based optimization techniques can be used for automatic reconfiguration of applications and for optimizing the deployment of load in cloud infrastructure. On the other hand, there are many situations in which the choice intrinsically requires human feedbacks; we will overview how in such situations it would be possible to drive optimization techniques by means of human interactive feedbacks.",,2013,"Di Penta, Massimiliano",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6632728,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Auto-tuning of Cloud-Based In-Memory Transactional Data Grids via Machine Learning,"In-memory transactional data grids have revealed extremely suited for cloud based environments, given that they well fit elasticity requirements imposed by the pay-as-you-go cost model. Particularly, the non-reliance on stable storage devices simplifies dynamic resize of these platforms, which typically only involves setting up (or shutting down) some data-cache instance. On the other hand, defining the well suited amount of cache servers to be deployed, and the degree of replication of slices of data, in order to optimize reliability/availability and performance tradeoffs, is far from being a trivial task. As a example, scaling up/down the size of the underlying infrastructure might give rise to scarcely predictable secondary effects on the side of the synchronization protocol adopted to guarantee data consistency while supporting transactional accesses. In this paper we investigate on the usage of machine learning approaches with the aim at providing a means for automatically tuning the data grid configuration, which is achieved via dynamic selection of both the well suited amount of cache servers, and the well suited degree of replication of the data-objects. The final target is to determine configurations that are able to guarantee specific throughput or latency values (such as those established by some SLA), under some specific workload profile/intensity, while minimizing at the same time the cost for the cloud infrastructure. Our proposal has been integrated within an operating environment relying on the well known Infinispan data grid, namely a mainstream open source product by the Red Had JBoss division.

,SLA-Based Profit Optimization in Cloud Bursting PaaS,"PaaS (Platform as a Service) is an increasingly popular cloud model, providing a complete development and hosting environment for cloud applications. As the use of PaaS becomes pervasive, defining and maintaining SLAs (Service Level Agreements) between PaaS customers and providers becomes essential. Useful SLAs should provide guarantees on application quality properties (e.g., response time) rather than on resource availability (e.g., number of virtual machines). Current PaaS offerings either provide no support for providing such guarantees or provide support targeting a restricted set of application types. In this paper, we present an SLA-driven PaaS architecture, called Meryn, which supports cloud bursting and is designed to be easily extensible to host new application types. We propose a decentralized optimization policy aiming at maximizing the PaaS provider profit and taking into account the payment of penalties incurred when quality guarantees are unsatisfied. In addition, we apply the proposed optimization policy to batch and MapReduce applications. We implemented and evaluated our policy through a series of simulations on the Grid5000 test bed. The results show that our approach provides up to 14.77\% more profit for the provider and uses up to 80.99\% less public clouds resources compared with a basic approach.",,2014,"Dib, Djawida; Parlavantzas, Nikos & Morin, Christine",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846449,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

In this work we specifically focus on SLA-QoS aspects, describing how to provide SLA based QoS guarantees through Cloud@Home on top of non-QoS oriented Cloud Providers.

,Energy Efficient VM Placement Supported by Data Analytic Service,"The popularity and commercial use of cloud computing has prompted an increased concern among cloud service providers for energy efficiency while still maintaining quality of service. One of the key techniques used for the efficient use of cloud server resources is virtual machine placement. This work introduces a precise VM placement algorithm that ensures energy efficiency and also prevents Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. The mathematical model of the algorithm is supported by a sophisticated data analytic system implemented as a service. The precision of the algorithm is achieved by allowing each individual VM to build its own data model on demand over an appropriate time horizon. Thus the data model can reflect accurately the characteristics of resource usage of the VM. The algorithm can communicate synchronously or asynchronously with the data analytic service which is deployed as a cloud-based solution. In the experiments, several advanced data modelling and use forecasting techniques were evaluated. Results from simulation-based experiments show that the VM placement algorithm (supported by the data analytic service) can effectively reduce power consumption, the number of VM migrations, and prevent SLA violation, it also compares very favourably with other placement algorithms.",,2013,"Dong, Dapeng & Herbert, John",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546152,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Owing to the dynamic nature of the cloud, continuous monitoring on trust attributes is necessary to enforce service-level agreements. This study presents Cloud-Trust, an adaptive trust management model for efficiently evaluating the competence of a cloud service based on its multiple trust attributes. In Cloud-Trust, two kinds of adaptive modelling tools (rough set and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA) operator) are organically integrated and successfully applied to trust data mining and knowledge discovery. Using rough set to discover knowledge from trust attributes makes the model surpass the limitations of traditional models, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Moreover, Cloud-Trust uses the IOWA operator to aggregate the global trust degree based on time series, thereby enabling better real-time performance. Experimental results show that Cloud-Trust converges more rapidly and accurately than do existing approaches, thereby verifying that it can effectively take on trust measurement tasks in cloud computing.",,2013,"Du, Junping & Li, Xiaoyong",http://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0232,,SLA and Cloud
,SUITS: How to make a global IT service provider sustainable?,"IT Service Providers are faced with the challenge to reconcile their goals in providing services efficiently and with the quality of services required while sustaining the environment.

The service providers have flexibility of selecting best locations for delivery of a service by taking into consideration operational cost associated with green gas emissions. They can also buy or sell carbon credits in a carbon trading market to maintain sustainable operational performance. In this paper, we introduce the Sustainable IT Services (SUITS) framework to develop models for operational performance of an IT Service Provider in a global environment with carbon taxation and carbon credit trading markets.

,An energy aware framework for virtual machine placement in cloud federated data centres,"Data centres are powerful ICT facilities which constantly evolve in size, complexity, and power consumption. At the same time users' and operators' requirements become more and more complex. However, existing data centre frameworks do not typically take energy consumption into account as a key parameter of the data centre's configuration. To lower the power consumption while fulfilling performance requirements we propose a flexible and energy-aware framework for the (re)allocation of virtual machines in a data centre. The framework, being independent from the data centre management system, computes and enacts the best possible placement of virtual machines based on constraints expressed through service level agreements. The framework's flexibility is achieved by decoupling the expressed constraints from the algorithms using the Constraint Programming (CP) paradigm and programming language, basing ourselves on a cluster management library called Entropy. Finally, the experimental and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving the pursued energy optimization goals.",,2012,"Dupont, Corentin; Schulze, Thomas; Giuliani, Giovanni; Somov, Andrey & Hermenier, Fabien",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2208828.2208832,ACM Press,SLA and Cloud

In particular, the âPiggypackâ option which consists in bridging a contract from one entity to another in an ethical way has been almost globally generalized since 2005. Although cloud software services are natively designed for convergent needs, its apparent attractiveness has to be precisely qualified, especially in the cases where this ""Piggyback"" option is contractually defined. In this paper, we study the specific problems that can be experienced in the definition process of cloud software services when implementing cooperative procurement. In particular, we show the particular importance of the scalability of the contractually defined SLA themselves in this context. We propose some best practices. One is based on the use of meta-SLA and sub-SLA concepts.

,Approximation Techniques for Maintaining Real-Time Deployments Informed by User-Provided Dataflows within a Cloud,"Distributed applications are increasingly developed by composing many participants, such as services, components, and objects. When deploying distributed applications into a mobile ad hoc cloud, the locality of application participants that communicate with each other can affect latency, power/-battery usage, throughput, and whether or not a cloud provider can meet service-level agreements (SLA). Optimization of important communication links within a distributed application is particularly important when dealing with mission-critical applications deployed in a distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) scenario, where violation of SLAs may result in loss of property, cyber infrastructure, or lives. To complicate the optimization process, the underlying cloud environment can change during operation and an optimal deployment of the distributed application may degrade over time due to hardware failures, overloaded hosts, and other issues that are beyond the control of distributed application developers. To optimize performance of distributed applications in dynamic environments, therefore, the deployment of participants may need adapting and revising according to the requirements of application developers and the resources available in the underlying cloud environment. This paper present two contributions to the study of dynamic optimizations of user-provided deployments within a cloud. First, we present a dataflow description language that allows developers to designate key communication paths between participants within their distributed applications. Second, we describe heuristics that use this dataflow representation to identify optimal configurations for initial deployments and/or subsequent redeployments within a cloud.

After the scheduling of Cloudlets, Single Threshold based VM provisioning or Two Threshold based VM provisioning is done at the Cloud Provider. In the proposed Two Threshold and Single Threshold based VM provisioning algorithms, a cost effective Data center selection policy is used for selecting the Data center with minimum cost. It can be shown that Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations can be minimized by using Two Threshold based VM provisioning algorithm when compared to Single Threshold based VM provisioning algorithm. It is observed that profit of Cloud Service is increased by Two Threshold based VM provisioning algorithm.",,2013,"Edwin, A. Chinnu & Madheswari, A.

,Performance of Cloud Computing Centers with Multiple Priority Classes,"In this paper we consider the general problem of resource provisioning within cloud computing. We analyze the problem of how to allocate resources to different clients such that the service level agreements (SLAs) for all of these clients are met. A model with multiple service request classes generated by different clients is proposed to evaluate the performance of a cloud computing center when multiple SLAs are negotiated between the service provider and its customers. For each class, the SLA is specified by the request rejection probabilities of the clients in that class. The proposed solution supports cloud service providers in the decision making about 1) defining realistic SLAs, 2) the dimensioning of data centers, 3) whether to accept new clients, and 4) the amount of resources to be reserved for high priority clients. We illustrate the potential of the solution by a number of experiments conducted for a large and therefore realistic number of resources.",,2012,"Ellens, Wendy; Ivkovic, Miroslav; Akkerboom, Jacob; Litjens, Remco & van den Berg, Hans",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353805 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253512,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Autonomous resource provision in virtual data centers,"In recent years the advances in cloud computing and virtualization have created the need for autonomic resource provision. The correct provisioning of resources is a difficult task due to variations and uncertainty in workload demands. Most data center workload demands are very spiky in nature and often vary significantly during the course of a single day. Because the resource availability in a data center is generally unpredictable due to the shared feature of the cloud resources and because of the stochastic nature of the workload, severe service level agreement (SLA) violations may occur frequently. To overcome this problem, researcher's attention is diverted towards developing dynamic resource management strategies. In this paper, an autonomic resource controller is proposed that dynamically controls the resource allocation for data center's virtual containers. The controller has two parts: A resource modeler that models the non-linearity of the system by employing different Machine Learning techniques allowing the datacenter to allocate the appropriate resources and a resource fuzzy tuner that dynamically tunes the allocated resources using fuzzy logic to sustain the desired performance taking into consideration the enforcing of service differentiation among clients. Experimental results on a real data center dataset showed that the proposed resource controller can predict future resource needs while still sustaining performance goals stated in the SLA. Also, using the bagging and the boosting techniques along with model tree classifiers was demonstrated to be promising in terms of accuracy and performance.",,2013,"Elprince, N.",,,SLA and Cloud

,SLA-Aware Application Deployment and Resource Allocation in Clouds,"Provisioning resources as a service in a scalable on-demand manner is a basic feature in Cloud computing technology. Service provisioning in Clouds is based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) representing a contract signed between the customer and the service provider stating the terms of the agreement including non-functional requirements of the service specified as Quality of Service (QoS), obligations, and penalties in case of agreement violations. On the one hand SLA violation should be prevented to avoid costly penalties and on the other hand providers have to efficiently utilize resources to minimize cost for the service provisioning. Thus, scheduling strategies considering multiple SLA parameters and efficient allocation of resources are necessary. Recent work considers various strategies with single SLA parameters. However, those approaches are limited to simple workflows and single task applications. Scheduling and deploying service requests considering multiple SLA parameters such as amount of CPU required, network bandwidth, memory and storage are still open research challenges. In this paper, we present a novel scheduling heuristic considering multiple SLA parameters for deploying applications in Clouds. We discuss in details the heuristic design and implementation and finally present detailed evaluations as a proof of concept emphasizing the performance of our approach.",,2011,"Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Brandic, Ivona; Maurer, Michael & Breskovic, Ivan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2056316.2057026 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6032254,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Low Level Metrics to High Level SLAs -- LoM2HiS framework: Bridging the gap between monitored metrics and,"Cloud computing represents a novel on-demand computing approach where resources are provided in compliance to a set of predefined non-functional properties specified and negotiated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to avoid costly SLA violations and to timely react to failures and environmental changes, advanced SLA enactment strategies are necessary, which include appropriate resource-monitoring concepts. Currently, Cloud providers tend to adopt existing monitoring tools, as for example those from Grid environments. However, those tools are usually restricted to locality and homogeneity of monitored objects, are not scalable, and do not support mapping of low-level resource metrics e.g., system up and down time to high-level application specific SLA parameters e.g., system availability. In this paper we present a novel framework for managing the mappings of the Low-level resource Metrics to High-level SLAs (LoM2HiS framework). The LoM2HiS framework is embedded into FoSII infrastructure, which facilitates autonomic SLA management and enforcement. Thus, the LoM2HiS framework detects future SLA violation threats and can notify the enactor component to act so as to avert the threats. We discuss the conceptual model of the LoM2HiS framework, followed by the implementation details. Finally, we present the first experimental results and a proof of concept of the LoM2HiS framework.",,2010,"Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Brandic, Ivona; Maurer, Michael & Dustdar, Schahram",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.189.2131 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5547150,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,CASViD: Application Level Monitoring for SLA Violation Detection in Clouds,"Cloud resources and services are offered based on Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that state usage terms and penalties in case of violations. Although, there is a large body of work in the area of SLA provisioning and monitoring at infrastructure and platform layers, SLAs are usually assumed to be guaranteed at the application layer. However, application monitoring is a challenging task due to monitored metrics of the platform or infrastructure layer that cannot be easily mapped to the required metrics at the application layer. Sophisticated SLA monitoring among those layers to avoid costly SLA penalties and maximize the provider profit is still an open research challenge. This paper proposes an application monitoring architecture named CASViD, which stands for Cloud Application SLA Violation Detection architecture. CASViD architecture monitors and detects SLA violations at the application layer, and includes tools for resource allocation, scheduling, and deployment. Different from most of the existing monitoring architectures, CASViD focuses on application level monitoring, which is relevant when multiple customers share the same resources in a Cloud environment. We evaluate our architecture in a real Cloud testbed using applications that exhibit heterogeneous behaviors in order to investigate the effective measurement intervals for efficient monitoring of different application types. The achieved results show that our architecture, with low intrusion level, is able to monitor, detect SLA violations, and suggest effective measurement intervals for various workloads.",,2012,"Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Ferreto, Tiago C.; Netto, Marco.

,Towards autonomic detection of SLA violations in Cloud infrastructures,"Cloud computing has become a popular paradigm for implementing scalable computing infrastructures provided on-demand on a case-by-case basis. Self-manageable Cloud infrastructures are required in order to comply with users’ requirements defined by Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and to minimize user interactions with the computing environment. Thus, adequate SLA monitoring strategies and timely detection of possible SLA violations represent challenging research issues. This paper presents the Detecting SLA Violation infrastructure (DeSVi) architecture, sensing SLA violations through sophisticated resource monitoring. Based on the user requests, DeSVi allocates computing resources for a requested service and arranges its deployment on a virtualized environment. Resources are monitored using a novel framework capable of mapping low-level resource metrics (e.g., host up and down time) to user-defined SLAs (e.g., service availability). The detection of possible SLA violations relies on the predefined service level objectives and utilization of knowledge databases to manage and prevent such violations. We evaluate the DeSVi architecture using two application scenarios: (i) image rendering applications based on ray-tracing, and (ii) transactional web applications based on the well-known TPC-W benchmark. These applications exhibit heterogeneous workloads for investigating optimal monitoring interval of SLA parameters. The achieved results show that our architecture is able to monitor and detect SLA violations.

In this paper, we take into account the cooling and network structure of the datacenter host ing the physical machines when consolidating the VMs so that fewer racks and routers are employed, without compromising the service-level agreements; consequently, idle routing and cooling equipment can be turned off in order to reduce the energy consumption. Our experimental results on four benchmarks show that the proposed techniques improve energy consumption of servers, network equipment, and cooling systems by 2.5\%, 18.8\%, and 28.2\% respectively compared to state of the art, resulting in a total of 14.7\% energy improvement on average in the entire datacenter.",,2014,"Esfandiarpoor, Sina; Pahlavan, Ali & Goudarzi, Maziar",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004579061400233X,,SLA and Cloud

,Optimizing Resource allocation while handling SLA violations in Cloud Computing platforms,"In this paper, we study a resource allocation problem in the context of Cloud Computing, in which a set of Virtual Machines (VM) has to be allocated on a set of Physical Machines (PM). Each VM has a given demand (e.g. CPU demand), and each PM has a capacity. However, VMs only use a fraction of their demand. The aim is to exploit the difference between the demand of the VM and its actual resource usage, to achieve a higher utilization on the PMs. However, the resource consumption of the VMs might change over time (while staying under its original demand), implying sometimes expensive “SLA violations” when the demand of some VMs is not satisfied because of overloaded PMs. Thus, while optimizing the global resource utilization of the PMs, it is necessary to ensure that at any moment a VM's need evolves, a few number of migrations (moving a VM from PM to PM) is sufficient to find a new configuration in which all the VMs' consumptions are satisfied. We model this problem using a fully dynamic bin packing approach and we present an algorithm ensuring a global utilization of the resources of 66\%. Moreover, each time a PM is overloaded, at most one migration is sufficient to fall back in a configuration with no overloaded PM, and at most 3 different PMs are concerned by required migrations that may occur to keep the global resource utilization correct. This allows the platform to be highly resilient to a great number of changes.",,2013,"Eyraud-Dubois, Lionel & Larcheveque, Hubert",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6569802 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2510661.2511430,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A new virtual network static embedding strategy within the Cloud’s private backbone network,"Cloud computing is a promising paradigm which has emerged to overcome the main issues of the computational world. It acts as a torchbearer technology for realising a new computing model in which resources can be acquired and released on demand. However, a fundamental issue in the instantiation of resources is how to afford optimal allocation so that the service provider fulfils the users’ service level agreement while minimising its operational cost and maximising its revenue. In this paper, we tackle the problem of networking static service provisioning within the Cloud’s private backbone network. This requires the embedding of virtual networks in which edge routers are directly connected to data centres. Our objective is to map online virtual networks in the private substrate backbone network using the minimum physical resources but while still satisfying the required QoS in terms of bandwidth, processing power and memory. This in turn minimises the reject rate of requests and maximises returns for the substrate network provider. Since the virtual network embedding problem is NP-hard, we propound a new scalable embedding strategy named VNE-AC to deal with its computational hardness. This is based on the Ant Colony metaheuristic. Extensive simulations are used to evaluate the performances of our proposal. These show that VNE-AC minimises the reject rate of virtual networks and enhances the cloud provider’s revenue.",,2014,"Fajjari, Ilhem; Aitsaadi, Nadjib; Pi\'{o}ro, Michał & Pujolle, Guy",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138912861400022X http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2598954.2599376,"Elsevier North-Holland, Inc.",SLA and Cloud
,A Model for Multi-levels SLA Monitoring in Federated Cloud Environment,"Cloud providers nowadays are required to form a federation of Clouds to remain competitive and gain a share in the Cloud service provision market. This provision is governed by a mutual contract known as Service Level Agreement (SLA), to which both clients and providers are confined. Monitoring activities should be undertaken to guarantee the pre-agreed SLA. However, monitoring multiple SLA in a federated Cloud depends highly on the collaboration among Cloud providers participating in satisfying a client service request, which makes it very challenging and complex. Monitoring linked SLAs requires a consistent specification of SLA parameters, dynamic SLA negotiation, and multi-level SLAs monitoring, in addition to a reliable enforcement measures. In this paper, we extend SLA specification to cope with the specificity of federation and its constraints. We also, propose a monitoring model that handles the complexity of managing a Multi-level monitoring and propose a solution to mitigate the cascading effect due to SLAs monitoring. Our monitoring scheme has the potential of efficiently reporting the source of performance violations, and its propagation to all dependent Cloud services. We evaluated our monitoring scheme using a series of experiments, and the results we have obtained are promising. They confirm that our scheme manages Multi-level SLAs in an efficient way, as it detects all violations, communicates these violations to concerned providers, and updates the SLAs accordingly.",,2013,"Falasi, Asma Al; Serhani, Mohamed Adel & Dssouli, Rachida",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2573041.2574126 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6726231,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An SLA-driven framework for dynamic multimedia content delivery federations,"Recently, the Internet has become a popular platform for the delivery of multimedia content. However, its best effort delivery approach is ill-suited to guarantee the stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of many existing multimedia services, which results in a significant reduction of the Quality of Experience. This paper presents a solution to these problems, in the form of a framework for dynamically setting up federations between the stakeholders involved in the content delivery chain. More specifically, the framework provides an automated mechanism to set up end-to-end delivery paths from the content provider to the access Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which act as its direct customers and represent a group of end-users. Driven by Service Level Agreements (SLAs), QoS contracts are automatically negotiated between the content provider, the access ISPs, and the intermediary network domains along the delivery paths. These contracts capture the delivered QoS and resource reservation costs, which are subsequently used in the price negotiations between content provider and access ISPs. Additionally, it supports the inclusion of cloud providers within the federations, supporting on-the-fly allocation of computational and storage resources. This allows the automatic deployment and configuration of proxy caches along the delivery paths, which potentially reduce delivery costs and increase delivered quality.",,2012,"Famaey, J.; Latre, S.; Wauters, T. & De Turck, F.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6212058,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A novel trust management framework for multi-cloud environments based on trust service providers,"In this paper, we address the problem of trust management in multi-cloud environments based on a set of distributed Trust Service Providers (TSPs). These are independent third-party providers/trust agents, trusted by Cloud Providers (CPs), Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) and Cloud Service Users (CSUs), that provide trust related services to cloud participants. TSPs are distributed over the clouds, and they elicit raw trust evidence from different sources and in different formats. This evidence is information regarding the adherence of a CSP to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) for a cloud-based service and the feedback sent by CSUs. Using this information, they evaluate an objective trust and a subjective trust of CSPs. TSPs communicate among themselves through a trust propagation network that permits a TSP to obtain trust information about a CSP from other TSPs.

However, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) is essential for maintaining reliable quality of service between data centers and their users in the cloud environment. Therefore, reduction of the SLA violation level and power costs are considered as two objectives in this paper. We present a CPU usage prediction method based on the linear regression technique. The proposed approach approximates the short-time future CPU utilization based on the history of usage in each host. It is employed in the live migration process to predict over-loaded and under-loaded hosts. When a host becomes over-loaded, some VMs migrate to other hosts to avoid SLA violation. Moreover, first all VMs migrate from a host while it becomes under-loaded. Then, the host switches to the sleep mode for reducing power consumption.

,Towards an SLA-Based Service Allocation in Multi-cloud Environments,"Cloud computing popularity is growing rapidly and consequently the number of companies offering their services in the form of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is increasing. The diversity and usage benefits of the IaaS offers are encouraging SaaS providers to lease resources from the Cloud instead of operating their own data centers. This helps them to get rid of the maintenance overheads and better satisfy their customers which are more demanding in terms of service requirements nowadays. Such evolutionary tendency is leading to the emergence of new ways of service provisioning in which relying on infrastructure services of a single Cloud provider is not sufficient. Namely, the need of using Cloud services from multiple Clouds with various quality attributes and pricing models has been raised recently. Although service allocation based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) has been well investigated in Cloud computing so far, the new upcoming issues regarding to utilize multiple Clouds has led to new challenges. This paper looks at the service selection and allocation in a Multi-Cloud, as a delivery model of multiple Clouds, from the perspective of SaaS provider.

It is not an easy task to transform the customer-oriented service metrics into operating level metrics, and control the Cloud resources adaptively based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). This paper addresses the problem of maximizing the provider's revenue through SLA-based dynamic resource allocation as SLA plays a vital role in Cloud computing to bridge service providers and customers.

In this paper, a mOSAIC-based framework for providing distributed intrusion detection in Cloud Computing is proposed. It is an architectural framework that collects information at different Cloud architectural levels, using multiple distributed security components, which can be used to perform complex event correlation analysis to identify intrusions in the Cloud system that involve Service Level Agreement violations.",,2012,"Ficco, Massimo; Rak, Massimiliano & Di Martino, Beniamino",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6412410,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Building a Medical Research Cloud in the EASI-CLOUDS Project,"The demand for IT resources is constantly growing in the scientific area. The ability to store and process increasing amounts of data has transformed many research disciplines, like the life-sciences, which now rely on complex data processing and data analytics. Cloud environments are able to integrate and encapsulate possibly distributed resources and allow convenient and on-demand access to the corresponding services, tools, and complete work environments. The European research project EASI-CLOUDS (http://www. easi-clouds.eu) develops a platform for a convenient service delivery with special regard to service integration, monitoring, management, and Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation and with the option to federate cloud resources between multiple installations. In order to demonstrate the capabilities a use-case for a medical service cloud has been developed in close partnership with the Charité university hospital which has a high demand on computing resources for the research in MRI related diagnostics of brain diseases.

,The right tool for the job: Switching data centre management strategies at runtime,"Applications are shifting into large scale, virtualized data centres that provide resources on a pay-per-usage basis. Data centres must minimize resource consumption while providing enough resources to meet application requirements. To meet highly variable application demands, a dynamic approach to virtual machine (VM) management is required. This involves three basic management operations: (i) placing newly arrived VMs, (ii) migrating (moving) VMs off of highly utilized machines to avoid performance degradation, and (iii) migrating VMs off of underutilized machines so that they may be shut down to save power. We define a management strategy to consist of a set of policies that guide these three operations. We consider the goals of minimizing Service Level Agreement violations and minimizing power consumption. Developing a management strategy to achieve both of these goals is challenging, as the goals are often in conflict. We propose achieving both goals through dynamically switching between two management strategies, each with a single goal, depending on current data centre state. We propose three methods of dynamically switching strategies, and evaluate these methods through simulation. Dynamic strategy switching offers improved results over a single management strategy.",,2013,"Foster, G.; Keller, G.; Tighe, M.; Lutfiyya, H. & Bauer, M.",,,SLA and Cloud

,An Integrated Approach for Specifying and Enforcing SLAs for Cloud Services,"Cloud computing has evolved from the provisioning of virtual machines to the provisioning of complex services, delivered to customers under the terms of Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). SLAs specify the Quality of Service (QoS) that should be provided to customers as well as the billing model. A main concern for cloud service providers is to maintain the agreed SLA terms in order to avoid losses and penalties. Maintaining the SLA in turn requires translating the QoS to configurations of low-level mechanisms, able to enforce the agreed terms. Current systems provide no integrated support for SLA specification, translation, and enforcement. In this paper, we propose an approach for specifying and enforcing SLAs for cloud service providers. The approach covers the creation of SLA templates under a billing model, the design of performance and fault-tolerance QoS assurance mechanisms as well as the translation of QoS to appropriate configurations of those mechanisms. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using the Qu4DS framework for PaaS cloud providers. Moreover, we evaluate the impact of failures on the provider profit.

Specifically, this work proposes a framework that comprises multiple, configurable control loops and supports automatically adjusting service configurations and resource usage in order to maintain SLAs in the most cost-effective way.

,Cloud QoS Scaling by Fuzzy Logic,"One of the biggest advantages of cloud infrastructures is the elasticity. Cloud services are monitored and based on the resource utilization and performance load, they get scaled up or down, by provision or de-provision of cloud resources. The goal is to guarantee the customers an acceptable performance with a minimum of resources. Such Quality of Service (QoS) characteristics are stated in a contract, called Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiated between customer and provider. The approach of this paper shows that with additional imprecise information (e.g. expected daytime/week- time performance) modeled with fuzzy logic and used in a behavior, load and performance prediction model, the up and down scaling mechanism of a cloud service can be optimized.

,SLA-based virtual machine management for heterogeneous workloads in a cloud datacenter,"Efficient provisioning of resources is a challenging problem in cloud computing environments due to its dynamic nature and the need for supporting heterogeneous applications. Even though VM (Virtual Machine) technology allows several workloads to run concurrently and to use a shared infrastructure, still it does not guarantee application performance. Thus, currently cloud datacenter providers either do not offer any performance guarantee or prefer static VM allocation over dynamic, which leads to inefficient utilization of resources. Moreover, the workload may have different QoS (Quality Of Service) requirements due to the execution of different types of applications such as HPC and web, which makes resource provisioning much harder. Earlier work either concentrate on single type of SLAs (Service Level Agreements) or resource usage patterns of applications, such as web applications, leading to inefficient utilization of datacenter resources. In this paper, we tackle the resource allocation problem within a datacenter that runs different types of application workloads, particularly non-interactive and transactional applications. We propose an admission control and scheduling mechanism which not only maximizes the resource utilization and profit, but also ensures that the QoS requirements of users are met as specified in SLAs. In our experimental study, we found that it is important to be aware of different types of SLAs along with applicable penalties and the mix of workloads for better resource provisioning and utilization of datacenters.

,Observations of the Earth's topography from the Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA): Laser-pulse Echo-recovery measurements of terrestrial surfaces,"Meter-precision topographic measurements of a diverse suite of terrestrial surfaces have been accomplished from Earth orbit using the Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA) instrument flown aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour in January of 1996. Over three million laser pulses were directed at the Earth by the SLA system during its ∼ 80 hours of nadir-pointing operation at an orbital altitude of 305 km (+/- 10 km). Approximately 90\% of these pulses resulted in valid range measurements to ocean, land, and cloud features. Of those which were fired at land targets, 57\% resulted in valid surface ranges, the remainder being cloud tops, false alarms, or missed shots. The SLA incorporated an electronic echo-recovery system into a pulsed, time-of-flight laser altimeter instrument in order to capture and characterize the vertical structure within each 100 m diameter surface footprint. The echoes recorded by SLA demonstrate aspects of the vertical structure of the nearly ubiquitous vegetation cover on the planet, as well as sensitivity to local slopes, surface reflectivity, and vertical ruggedness. With a vertical resolution of 0.75 m and horizontal sampling at 0.7 km length scales, SLA provides a new form of high vertical accuracy topographic data for studying problems related to the dynamics of the Earth's surface. Assessment of the error budget associated with the SLA experiment suggests that ∼2.8 m (RMS) precision was achieved for ranging measurements to oceanic surfaces, for which there are over 700,000 examples. With the availability of a precision radial orbit and post-flight Shuttleattitude information, a mid-latitude (+ 28.5° to −28.5°), georeferenced database of topographic ground control point elevations has been achieved using SLA data, consisting of ∼ 344,000 land measurements. Each of these measurements is geolocated to within 1–2 SLA footprints (100–200 m) on the Earth's surface, with vertical errors that approach the limits of resolution (0.75 m) of the instrument in topographically benign regions. When compared to available Digital Elevation Models (DEM's) with stated vertical accuracies on the order of 10–16 m, SLA's measurements differ by no more than 11 m to 46 m RMS in rugged terrain. We have computed a total vertical roughness parameter for all multi-peaked SLA echoes using a multi-Gaussian decomposition technique and have observed a very high degree of correlation of this parameter with global landcover classes. In some cases (∼6\%), SLA echoes clearly resolve both the ground surface and vegetation canopy within a single footprint, suggesting that the modal height of equatorial vegetation is ∼ 18 m. The global distribution of total vertical roughness varies from ∼ 5 m to 60 m, with a mean value of 27 m and a standard deviation of 12 m. SLA successfully served as a pathfinder for high vertical resolution orbital topographic remote sensing instrumentation, and demonstrated the first high resolution echo-recovery laser altimeter observations over land surfaces.",,1998,"Garvin, J.; Bufton, J.; Blair, J.; Harding, D.; Luthcke, S.; Frawley, J. & Rowlands, D.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079194698001451,,SLA and Cloud

,Workflow scheduling for SaaS / PaaS cloud providers considering two SLA levels,"Cloud computing is being used to avoid maintenance costs and upfront investment, while providing elasticity to the available computational power in a pay-per-use basis. Customers can make use of the cloud as a software (SaaS), platform (PaaS), or infrastructure (IaaS) provider. When one customer utilizes an environment provided by a SaaS cloud, she is unaware of any details about the computational infrastructure where her requests are being processed. Therefore, such infrastructure can be composed of computational resources from a datacenter owned by the SaaS or its resources can be leased from a cloud infrastructure provider. In this paper we present an integer linear program (ILP) formulation for the problem of scheduling SaaS customer's workflows into multiple IaaS providers where SLA exists at two levels. In addition, we present heuristics to solve the relaxed version of the presented ILP. Simulation results show that the proposed ILP is able to find low-cost solutions for short deadlines, while the proposed heuristics are effective when deadlines are larger.",,2012,"Genez, T. A.

,Bee-MMT: A load balancing method for power consumption management in cloud computing,"Energy consumption management has become an essential concept in cloud computing. In this paper, we propose a new power aware load balancing, named Bee-MMT (artificial bee colony algorithm-Minimal migration time), to decline power consumption in cloud computing; as a result of this decline, CO2 production and operational cost will be decreased. According to this purpose, an algorithm based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) has been proposed to detect over utilized hosts and then migrate one or more VMs from them to reduce their utilization; following that we detect underutilized hosts and, if it is possible, migrate all VMs which have been allocated to these hosts and then switch them to the sleep mode. However, there is a trade-off between energy consumption and providing high quality of service to the customers. Consequently, we consider SLA Violation as a metric to qualify the QOS that require to satisfy the customers. The results show that the proposed method can achieve greater power consumption saving than other methods like LR-MMT (local regression-Minimal migration time), DVFS (Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling), IQR-MMT (Interquartile Range-MMT), MAD-MMT (Median Absolute Deviation) and non-power aware.",,2013,"Ghafari, Seyed Mohssen; Fazeli, Mahdi; Patooghy, Ahmad & Rikhtechi, Leila",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6612165,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Data centers to offer ancillary services,"Considering the growing number of Internet and cloud computing data centers being built in recent years and given the data centers' major and yet flexible electric load, they can be good candidates to offer ancillary services, such as voluntary load reduction, to a smart grid. In this paper, we investigate such potential within an analytical profit maximization framework to determine whether participation in an ancillary service market can be beneficial to data centers.

,Feedback-based optimization of a private cloud,"The optimization problem addressed by this paper involves the allocation of resources in a private cloud such that cost to the provider is minimized (through the maximization of resource sharing) while attempting to meet all client application requirements (as specified in the SLAs). At the heart of any optimization based resource allocation algorithm, there are two models: one that relates the application level quality of service to the given set of resources and one that maps a given service level and resource consumption to profit metrics. In this paper we investigate the optimization loop in which each application’s performance model is dynamically updated at runtime to adapt to the changes in the system. These changes could be perturbations in the environment that had not been included in the model. Through experimentation we show that using these tracking models in the optimization loop will result in a more accurate optimization and thus result in the generation of greater profit.",,2012,"Ghanbari, Hamoun; Simmons, Bradley; Litoiu, Marin & Iszlai, Gabriel",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X11001014,,SLA and Cloud

,Energy-efficient resource management of cloud datacenters under fault tolerance constraints,"The cloud computing as a ubiquitous paradigm could provide different services for internet users and Information Technology (IT) companies through datacenters that located around the world. However, cloud provider faces several problems such as high energy consumption and fault occurrence issues in cloud datacenters. Hence, cloud provider has to make a trade-off between energy and fault to gain more profit. In this paper, a migration method for the virtual machines to handle fault problem and prevent Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation is proposed by considering energy consumption constraints. The approach considers the lowest increasing in energy consumption and the minimal deadline miss ratio as the most significant factors for migration of each Virtual Machine (VM). The results show that low SLA violation is achieved with the least amount of energy consumption compared to other methods. It is also shown that the energy increasing by migration has an exponential relationship with the failure rate increasing.",,2013,"Ghoreyshi, Seyed Mohammad",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6604493,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,An approach to identify and monitor SLA parameters for storage-as-a-service cloud delivery model,"Cloud computing is an emerging technological paradigm that follows pay-as-you-use model. By this model, the consumers are charged according to the usage without regard to where the services are hosted or how they are delivered. Usually cloud services are offered as various delivery models among which Storage-as-a-Service cloud is gaining interest in recent time. In this model, raw (block) storage is offered as a service. Like any other utility services, cloud negotiates its service levels and guarantees with its consumers by establishing Service Level Agreements (SLAs). SLA is important in any provider-consumer interaction as it defines a formal basis for performance and availability the provider guarantees to deliver. It consists of a set of measurable attributes called SLA parameters which are established by some objectively measurable conditions, termed as Service Level Objectives (SLOs). However, the SLAs provided by the present day state-of-the-art clouds are relatively biased towards vendors and do not provide any formal method of verifying if the guarantees are complying or not. This paper attempts to identify the SLA parameters for Storage-as-a-Service cloud delivery model and proposes a monitoring framework for compliance checking.",,2012,"Ghosh, Nirnay & Ghosh, Soumya K",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6477664,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SelCSP: A Framework to Facilitate Selection of Cloud Service Providers,"With rapid technological advancements, cloud marketplace witnessed frequent emergence of new service providers with similar offerings. However, service level agreements (SLAs), which document guaranteed quality of service levels, have not been found to be consistent among providers, even though they offer services with similar functionality. In service outsourcing environments, like cloud, the quality of service levels are of prime importance to customers, as they use third-party cloud services to store and process their clients’ data. If loss of data occurs due to an outage, the customer’s business gets affected. Therefore, the major challenge for a customer is to select an appropriate service provider to ensure guaranteed service quality. To support customers in reliably identifying ideal service provider, this work proposes a framework, SelCSP, which combines trustworthiness and competence to estimate risk of interaction. Trustworthiness is computed from personal experiences gained through direct interactions or from feedbacks related to reputations of vendors. Competence is assessed based on transparency in provider’s SLA guarantees. A case study has been presented to demonstrate the application of our approach.

,Scalable Analytics for IaaS Cloud Availability,"In a large Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud, component failures are quite common. Such failures may lead to occasional system downtime and eventual violation of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) on the cloud service availability. The availability analysis of the underlying infrastructure is useful to the service provider to design a system capable of providing a defined SLA, as well as to evaluate the capabilities of an existing one. This paper presents a scalable, stochastic model-driven approach to quantify the availability of a large-scale IaaS cloud, where failures are typically dealt with through migration of physical machines among three pools: hot (running), warm (turned on, but not ready), and cold (turned off). Since monolithic models do not scale for large systems, we use an interacting Markov chain based approach to demonstrate the reduction in the complexity of analysis and the solution time. The three pools are modeled by interacting sub-models. Dependencies among them are resolved using fixed-point iteration, for which existence of a solution is proved. The analytic-numeric solutions obtained from the proposed approach and from the monolithic model are compared. We show that the errors introduced by interacting sub-models are insignificant and that our approach can handle very large size IaaS clouds. The simulative solution is also considered for the proposed model, and solution time of the methods are compared.",,2014,"Ghosh, Rahul; Longo, Francesco; Frattini, Flavio; Russo, Stefano & Trivedi, Kishor S.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6762970,,SLA and Cloud

In order to avoid tangling between QoS and communication-related concerns, this paper proposes the use of aspect-orientation to handle QoS on top of an existing web server, Jigsaw. We show how an aspect-based architecture can be effective for providing the web server with several improvements when processing incoming requests. QoS parameters have been handled by associating requests with priorities and by introducing into the web server checks on resource-usage and tasks to be executed. Suggested aspects are connected at compile-time to existing classes, hence keeping the QoS-enforcing code separated from web server modules.",,2012,"Giunta, Rosario; Messina, Fabrizio; Pappalardo, Giuseppe & Tramontana, Emiliano",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2360026.2360644 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6269723,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Formation of Dynamic Collaborative Cloud Links Based on Provider Capability Cost and Resource Health Monitoring,"Typically in collaborative cloud systems, the collaborations are formed based on pre-negotiated terms and conditions. Care is taken to ensure that the resources are planned in such a way so as to satisfy the SLA requirements. However, these static collaborations pose certain challenges in the long run, which arise due to the changes in quality of resources and provider capabilities. In such a scenario, there is a need to dynamically establish appropriate collaborations so as to back-fill the resource quality and overcome shortfalls in provider capabilities. Our paper puts forth a mathematical model for cloud provider capabilities along with an approach to establish dynamic cloud provider collaborations. In our approach, once the under functioning resource is identified, we are able to find the most suitable replacement resource from within the same cloud provider or if need be, establish a new collaboration with another provider based on the required resource capabilities. This choice for new collaboration is based on the tenancy requirements, current state of resource utilization and capacity, and health of the specific resource to be replaced. Our algorithms to determine the replacement resource and form the collaboration links are illustrated along with a running example and proof-of-concept implementation.",,2012,"Gohad, Atul; Rao, Praveen S.; Narendra, Nanjangud C. & Ponnalagu, Karthikeyan",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6354609,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Supporting CPU-based guarantees in cloud SLAs via resource-level QoS metrics,"Success of Cloud computing requires that both customers and providers can be confident that signed Service Level Agreements (SLA) are supporting their respective business activities to their best extent. Currently used SLAs fail in providing such confidence, especially when providers outsource resources to other providers. These resource providers typically support very simple metrics like availability, or metrics that hinder an efficient exploitation of their resources. In this paper, we propose a resource-level metric for specifying fine-grain guarantees on CPU performance. This metric allows resource providers to allocate dynamically their resources among running services depending on their demand. This is accomplished by incorporating the customer’s CPU usage in the metric definition, but avoiding fake SLA violations when the customer’s task does not use all its allocated resources. We have conducted the evaluation in a virtualized provider where we have implemented the needed infrastructure for using our metric. As demonstrated in our evaluation, our solution presents fewer SLA violations than other CPU-related metrics while maintaining the Quality of Service.",,2012,"Goiri, \'{I}\ {n}igo; Juli\`{a}, Ferran; Fit\'{o}, J.

Within this context, this work proposes a generic SLA negotiation protocol for Virtualized Environments (VEs).

Fulfilling the stipulated availability may be expensive, due to the cost of failure recovery software, and the amount of physical equipment needed to deploy the cloud services. Therefore, a relevant question for cloud providers is: How to guarantee the SLA availability in a cost efficient way? This paper studies different fault tolerance techniques available in the market, and it proposes the use of an hybrid management to have full control over the SLA risk, using only the necessary resources in order to keep a cost efficient operation. This paper shows how to model the probability distribution of the accumulated downtime, and how this can be used in the design of hybrid policies. Using specific case studies, this paper illustrates how to implement the proposed hybrid policies, and it shows the obtained cost saving by using them.

Finally, this paper proposes the use of the SLA -budget for the implementation of smart policies in: i) the assignment of spare servers when virtual machines are restored. ii) the dynamic use of different fault tolerance licenses.

,SLA-based Optimization of Power and Migration Cost in Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing systems (or hosting datacenters) have attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Utility computing, reliable data storage, and infrastructure-independent computing are example applications of such systems. Electrical energy cost of a cloud computing system is a strong function of the consolidation and migration techniques used to assign incoming clients to existing servers. Moreover, each client typically has a service level agreement (SLA), which specifies constraints on performance and/or quality of service that it receives from the system. These constraints result in a basic trade-off between the total energy cost and client satisfaction in the system. In this paper, a resource allocation problem is considered that aims to minimize the total energy cost of cloud computing system while meeting the specified client-level SLAs in a probabilistic sense. The cloud computing system pays penalty for the percentage of a client's requests that do not meet a specified upper bound on their service time. An efficient heuristic algorithm based on convex optimization and dynamic programming is presented to solve the aforesaid resource allocation problem.

,Resource allocation and consolidation in a multi-core server cluster using a Markov decision process model,"Distributed computing systems have attracted a lot of attention due to increasing demand for high performance computing and storage. Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the distributed systems especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. In this paper, an SLA-based resource allocation problem in a server cluster is considered. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is the total price gained from serving the clients subtracted by the operation cost of the server cluster. The total price depends on the average request response time for each client as defined in their utility functions, while the operating cost is related to the total energy consumption. A joint optimization framework is proposed, comprised of request dispatching, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for individual cores, as well as server-level and core-level consolidations. Each core in the cluster is modeled using a continuous-time Markov decision process (CTMDP). A near-optimal hierarchical solution is proposed, consisting of a central manager and distributed local agents. Each local agent employs linear programming-based CTMDP solving method to solve the DVFS problem for the corresponding core. The central manager solves the request dispatching problem and finds the optimal number of turned on cores and servers for request processing, thereby achieving a desirable tradeoff between service request response time and power consumption. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed near-optimal resource allocation and consolidation algorithm consistently outperforms baseline algorithms.",,2013,"Goudarzi, H. & Pedram, M.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6523677,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Distributed Learning Algorithms for Inter-NSP SLA Negotiation Management,"To support real-time and security-demanding applications (e.g. telepresence, cloud computing) at a large-scale, the Internet must evolve so that Network Service Providers (NSPs) provide end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) across their networks. The delivery of such QoS-assured services requires the negotiation of end-to-end QoS contracts (Service Level Agreements, SLAs) among NSPs and the configuration of their networks accordingly. The management of inter-NSP SLA negotiation is usually treated as an optimization problem, assuming that NSPs cooperate and agree on a common system, providing a solution for each demand. This assumption is quite strong in a highly competitive context where NSPs are cautious about sensitive data disclosure like topology or resource usage information or even SLA descriptions and prices. Hence, to meet NSPs' requirements on confidentiality, we opt for a distributed framework. In order to not over-provision demands, we consider the problem in a wider range: not only on the basis of instantaneous requests but also anticipating future ones. To enhance the chance of an NSP to be selected for an end-to-end service, we aim to take into account the demander likeliness of acceptance (aka. customer utility). To this end, we opt for reinforcement learning techniques and propose three distributed algorithms, inspired by the Q-learning algorithm, having different cooperation levels.",,2012,"Groleat, Tristan & Pouyllau, Helia",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6247444,,SLA and Cloud

Other crucial needs must be considered: QoS should provide incentives to network operators, and confidentiality on topologies, resource states and committed SLAs must be respected. To meet these requirements, we propose two distributed learning algorithms that will allow network operators to negotiate end-to-end SLAs and optimize revenues for several demands while treating requests in real-time: one algorithm minimizes the cooperation between providers while the other demands to exchange more information.

,Quality of service modeling for green scheduling in Clouds,"Most Cloud providers support services under constraints of Service Level Agreement (SLA) definitions. The SLAs are composed of different quality of service (QoS) rules promised by the provider. Thus, the QoS in Clouds becomes more and more important. Precise definitions and metrics have to be explained. This article proposes an overview of Cloud QoS parameters as well as their classification, but also it defines usable metrics to evaluate QoS parameters. Moreover, the defined QoS metrics are measurable and reusable in any scheduling approach for Clouds. The use of these QoS models is done through the performance analysis of three scheduling approaches considering four QoS parameters. In addition to the energy consumption and the Response Time, two other QoS parameters are taken into account in different virtual machines scheduling approaches. These parameters are dynamism and robustness, which are usually not easily measurable. The evaluation is done through simulations, using two common scheduling algorithms and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for virtual machines (VMs) reallocation, allowing us to analyze the QoS parameters evolution in time. Simulation results have shown that including various and antagonist QoS parameters allows a deeper analysis of the intrinsic behavior and insight of these three algorithms.

,Energy-Efficient SLA Guarantees for Virtualized GPU in Cloud Gaming,"Both power consumption and SLA guarantees are important concerns for cloud gaming. Recently, various approaches have been developed to effectively reduce GPU power consumption by making GPU run at low frequencies. However, Virtual Machines (VMs) running on the same physical GPU with virtualization technology are correlated, because the change of GPU frequencies will affect the SLA performance of all the VMs. In fact, both reducing power consumption and guaranteeing SLA should work together under the considerations of their correlations. This paper proposes a novel two-layer control architecture called EvGPU (Energy-efficient SLA guarantees for virtualized GPU) based on well-established feedback control techniques. The first control loop adopts a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to ensure SLA guarantees, which in particular are measured at a predefined level of the Frames Per Second (FPS) for each online game. The secondary power control loop then adjusts GPU frequency through Dynamic Voltage/Frequency Scaling (DVFS) to reduce power consumption based on the current FPS achieved by the first loop. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed solution can effectively reduce GPU power consumption, while achieving the required SLA performance in virtualized GPU for cloud gaming.",,2014,"haibing Guan; Yao, Jianguo; Qi, Zhengwei & Wang, Runze",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6881719,,SLA and Cloud

,Building a Compliance Vocabulary to Embed Security Controls in Cloud SLAs,"Mission critical information systems must be certified against a set of security controls to mitigate potential security incidents. Cloud service providers must in turn employ adequate security measures that conform to security controls expected by the organizational information systems they host. Since service implementation details are abstracted away by the cloud, organizations can only rely on service level agreements (SLAs) to assess the compliance of cloud security properties and processes. Various representation schema allow SLAs to embed service security terms, but are disconnected from documents regulating security controls. This paper demonstrates an extensible solution for building a compliance vocabulary that associates SLA terms with security controls. The terms allow services to express which security controls they comply with and enable at-a-glance comparison of security service offerings so organizations can distinguish among cloud service providers that best comply with security expectations. To exemplify the approach, we build a sample vocabulary of terms based on audit security controls from a standard set of governing documents and apply them to an SLA for an example cloud storage service. We assess the compatibility with existing SLAs and calculate the computational overhead associated with the use of our approach in service matchmaking.",,2013,"Hale, Matthew L. & Gamble, Rose",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2552868.2552883 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6655684,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Risk propagation of security SLAs in the cloud,"For organizations with mission critical systems, moving data or functionality to the cloud introduces a risk of additional exposed vulnerabilities associated with cloud service providers not implementing organizationally selected security controls. When internal system details are abstracted away as part of the cloud architecture, the organization must rely on contractual obligations embedded in service level agreements (SLAs) to assess service offerings for security risk. Whenever an SLA is formed, the level of risk incurred is based on how well the offered service terms meet the organizational security demands. In the cloud, additional SLAs between third party cloud service providers are formed to federate cloud resources, effectively distributing organizational risk among the various providers involved in the negotiated federations or service compositions. At runtime, whenever a cloud or service violates its SLA with respect to security controls or cancels any security offerings, the risk of noncompliance with organizational security policies increases. This paper provides a process to adapt to the propagated changes of service provider security risks within a service composition or federation due to SLA violations. The process is based on a distributed risk-aware renegotiation algorithm that replaces services if they violate SLAs.",,2012,"Hale, Matthew L. & Gamble, Rose",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.366.1913 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6477665,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SecAgreement: Advancing Security Risk Calculations in Cloud Services,"By choosing to use cloud services, organizations seek to reduce costs and maximize efficiency. For mission critical systems that must satisfy security constraints, this push to the cloud introduces risks associated with cloud service providers not implementing organizationally selected security controls or policies. As internal system details are abstracted away as part of the cloud architecture, the organization must rely on contractual obligations embedded in service level agreements (SLAs) to assess service offerings. Current SLAs focus on quality of service metrics and lack the semantics needed to express security constraints that could be used to measure risk. We create a framework, called SecAgreement (SecAg), that extends the current SLA negotiation standard, WS-Agreement, to allow security metrics to be expressed on service description terms and service level objectives. The framework enables cloud service providers to include security in their SLA offerings, increasing the likelihood that their services will be used. We define and exemplify a cloud service matchmaking algorithm to assess and rank SecAg enhanced WS-Agreements by their risk, allowing organizations to quantify risk, identify any policy compliance gaps that might exist, and as a result select the cloud services that best meet their security needs.",,2012,"Hale, Matthew L. & Gamble, Rose",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6274042 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2358963.2359669,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Holistic SLA Ontology for Cloud Service Evaluation,"With the evolution of service computing ecosystems and the promises of the Cloud, there is an increasing need for service evaluation and monitoring across a wide range of QoS dimensions. Although in the literature service monitoring is tightly coupled with Service Level Agreement establishment, existing approaches do not provide a holistic model for Cloud service evaluation. In this paper, we present an SLA ontology, encompassing the whole service lifecycle, in order to drive and improve the evaluation of services. We propose a common QoS ontology to express specifications, requirements and feedback. Based on this, we introduce a symmetric representation of service monitoring information and human feedback, allowing a unified management of the service evaluation. Finally, the SLA ontology supports the profiling of users, enabling a refined reputation calculation through the dynamic consideration of customer segments.",,2013,"Hamadache, Kahina & Rizou, Stamatia",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623378.2623474 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6824569,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Transactional Risk Assessment-Based Approach for Service Degradability Management,"In Cloud Computing, service level degradation is a crucial phenomenon that will have an impact on businesses outcome. This impact in business domain could be measured in terms of not achieving the desired outcomes and loss of investment. On the basis of this measurement, a decision has to be made by the service requester on the continuation of that service or re-composing it. In the literature, approaches have been proposed that allow for service re-composition in Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) but in Cloud Computing techniques are needed that analyze the chances and affect of Service Degradability and assist in making informed service management decision. Such analysis is achieved by the assessment of transactional risk. In this paper we propose a methodology that analyses the transactional risk and proposes assessments that can be utilized to make informed decisions.",,2011,"Hammadi, Adil M. & Hussain, Omar",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6104611 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2083737.2083828,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

The main drawback of cloud networking consists in the lack of Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee and management in conformance with a corresponding Service Level Agreement (SLA). Several research works have been proposed for the SLA establishing in cloud computing, but not in cloud networking. In this paper, we propose an architecture for self-establishing an end-to-end service level agreement between a Cloud Service User (CSU) and a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) in a cloud networking environment.

Moreover, videoconferencing is a very demanding application in terms of bandwidth, delay and CPU resources that we have to guarantee.

,Cashing in on the Cache in the Cloud,"Over the past decades, caching has become the key technology used for bridging the performance gap across memory hierarchies via temporal or spatial localities; in particular, the effect is prominent in disk storage systems. Applications that involve heavy I/O activities, which are common in the cloud, probably benefit the most from caching. The use of local volatile memory as cache might be a natural alternative, but many well-known restrictions, such as capacity and the utilization of host machines, hinder its effective use. In addition to technical challenges, providing cache services in clouds encounters a major practical issue (quality of service or service level agreement issue) of pricing. Currently, (public) cloud users are limited to a small set of uniform and coarse-grained service offerings, such as High-Memory and High-CPU in Amazon EC2. In this paper, we present the cache as a service (CaaS) model as an optional service to typical infrastructure service offerings. Specifically, the cloud provider sets aside a large pool of memory that can be dynamically partitioned and allocated to standard infrastructure services as disk cache. We first investigate the feasibility of providing CaaS with the proof-of-concept elastic cache system (using dedicated remote memory servers) built and validated on the actual system, and practical benefits of CaaS for both users and providers (i.e., performance and profit, respectively) are thoroughly studied with a novel pricing scheme. Our CaaS model helps to leverage the cloud economy greatly in that 1) the extra user cost for I/O performance gain is minimal if ever exists, and 2) the provider's profit increases due to improvements in server consolidation resulting from that performance gain. Through extensive experiments with eight resource allocation strategies, we demonstrate that our CaaS model can be a promising cost-efficient solution for both users and providers.",,2012,"Han, Hyuck; Lee, Young Choon; Shin, Woong; Jung, Hyungsoo; Yeom, Heon Y. & Zomaya, Albert Y.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2360765.2361187 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6095538,IEEE Press,SLA and Cloud
,Support Vector regression for Service Level Agreement violation prediction,"SLA is a contract between service providers and consumers, mandating specific numerical target values which the service needs to achieve. For service providers, preventing SLA violation becomes very important to enhance customer trust and avoid penalty charging. Therefore, it is necessary for providers to forecast possible violations as much as possible before they actually happen. Time series analysis based on Support Vector Machine for regression is proposed for predicting SLA violations. It will analyse historical data of performance to provide estimated upcoming data. A validation using 120 days sample data shows that Support Vector Machine could predict service performance data in cloud database. The prediction accuracy is considerably high in this particular case; it is more than 80\%.",,2013,"Hani, Ahmad Fadzil M; Paputungan, Irving Vitra & Hassan, M Fadzil",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6819192,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

In this paper, a cloud computing architecture is proposed from the viewpoint of business-driven IT management (BDIM); then an optimal cloud infrastructure design methodology is devised, whereby numbers of servers, routers and communication bandwidth can be calculated through considering both infrastructure costs and business losses incurred by service level agreement (SLA) violations.

,Providing Green SLAs in High Performance Computing Clouds,"Demand for clean products and services is increasing as society is becoming increasingly aware of climate change. In response, many enterprises are setting explicit sustainability goals and implementing initiatives to reduce carbon emissions. Quantification and disclosure of such goals and initiatives have become important marketing tools. As enterprises and individuals shift their workloads to the cloud, this drive toward quantification and disclosure will lead to demand for quantifiable green cloud services. Thus, we argue that cloud providers should offer a new class of green services, in addition to existing (energy-source-oblivious) services. This new class would provide clients with explicit service-level agreements (which we call Green SLAs) for the percentage of renewable energy used to run their workloads. In this paper, we first propose an approach for High Performance Computing cloud providers to offer such a Green SLA service. Specifically, each client job specifies a Green SLA, which is the minimum percentage of green energy that must be used to run the job. The provider earns a premium for meeting the Green SLA, but is penalized if it accepts the job but violates the Green SLA. We then propose (1) a power distribution and control infrastructure that uses a small amount of hardware to support Green SLAs, (2) an optimization-based framework for scheduling jobs and power sources that maximizes provider profits while respecting Green SLAs, and (3) two scheduling policies based on the framework. We evaluate our framework and policies extensively through simulations. Our main results show the tradeoffs between our policies, and their advantages over simpler greedy heuristics. We conclude that a Green SLA service that uses our policies would enable the provider to attract environmentally conscious clients, especially those who require strict guarantees on their use of green energy.",,2013,"Haque, Md.

,SAA 02-3 - Intelligent Weather Systems with Fuzzy Logic Controller for Satellite Networks,"Weather attenuations can have a distorting effect on signal fidelity above 10 GHz that lead to excessive digital transmission error. This loss of signal is commonly referred to as signal attenuation. Signal attenuation impacts QoS in wireless and satellite networks. An intelligent decision support system is therefore necessary for service providers by accurately calculating rain, gaseous, cloud, fog, and scintillation attenuations using predicted signal-weather correlated database in collaboration with ITU-R propagation models combined with gateway, and ground terminal characteristics. The effect becomes a key feature in adjusting and improving satellite signal power, modulation and coding schemes, monitored and controlled altogether by a powerful and efficient intelligent-based attenuation countermeasure system. A three dimensional relationship is proposed among these attenuations with respect to propagation angle and rainfall rate (Harb et al., 2007).

,Intelligent Weather Aware Scheme for Satellite Systems,"Rain, snow, gaseous, cloud, fog, scintillation and other atmospheric properties can have a distorting effect on signal fidelity of Ku and Ka bands, thus resulting in excessive digital transmission error. This loss of signal is commonly referred to as signal attenuation. Signal attenuation impacts the QoS in wireless and satellite networks. Accurately predicting channel attenuation due to atmospheric conditions can enable mitigation planning by adaptively selecting appropriate modulation, coding, transmitted power level, transmission rate and configured frame size. The aim of this paper is to estimate different attenuations using predicted signal-weather correlated database in collaboration with ITU-R propagation models combined with interpolation methods, gateway, and ground terminal characteristics. A three dimensional relationship is proposed among these attenuations with respect to propagation angle and rainfall rate [l]-[8]. The outcome is key factor in diagnosing, adjusting and improving satellite signal power, modulation and coding schemes, monitored and controlled altogether by a powerful and efficient intelligent-based attenuation countermeasure system.

,Automated Negotiation Using Semantic Rules,"With the extensive adaptation of Web service based applications in dynamic businesses applications including on demand computing, highly configurable virtual solutions and cloud computing based systems demand automated tools for composing and managing these services in composite systems. The use of standard protocols for publishing, discovery, invocation, process definition and SLA definition etc. (e.g. UDDI, WSDL, SOAP, BPEL, WS-Agreement, WS-Policy) has made it possible to compose highly usable composite systems with minimal efforts. On the other hand the existence of a number of functionally equivalent service provide the system designers with the flexibility of choosing the most appropriate services for the system. Hence, automated negotiation among Web services provides an effective way for the services to bargain for their optimal customizations and allow the discovery of overlooked potential solutions. In this paper, we present a Web service negotiation framework that would be used by both the customer and providers of Web services for conducting automated negotiations for quality of service properties of Web services. Our proposed framework is highly flexible, protocol independent and supports participant polices for communication, negotiation and service level agreement creation. We further extend our approach by extending WS-Negotiation and WS-Renegotiation to model multi-round negotiation for multiple attributes of negotiated services in a multi-service and multi-party negotiation scenarios. We also describe a semantic web rules based approach for converting compatible participant policies for mutual comprehension of Web service.

,Risk-Aware Service Level Agreement Design for Enterprise Information Systems,"Effective information systems have become key to sustainable business practices. However rising costs of operation and a growing system complexity are driving the search for a more efficient delivery of corporate computing. New technologies in the emerging service world such as cloud computing provide powerful alternatives to traditional IT operation concepts. Nonetheless, executive decision makers still have reservations about migrating to this new technology. In addition to security concerns, a key issue is the still prevailing lack of strict SLAs in these service offerings. In fact, service providers hesitate to offer strictly binding SLAs because assessing economic risk exposure is a major challenge. In this paper, we present a novel model for sustainable SLA design for enterprise information systems. Our model combines various state-of-the-art concepts from the field of system management and balances the failure risk with the cost of operation. More concretely, our model helps IT decision makers to understand the relationship between the operation cost and the service quality.

,Resource management techniques for handling uncertainties in user estimated job execution times,"The popularity of clouds is growing rapidly. Research on cloud computing has stared considering Service Level Agreement (SLA) characterized by an earliest start time, runtime and a deadline for completion with a request for job execution submitted to the cloud. Estimates of request runtimes provided by users are often error prone. Both overestimation and underestimation of request runtimes are detrimental for system performance. Satisfying SLAS often require Advance Reservation (AR) of resources. This research presents a Soft Advance Reservation (SAR) approach for handling errors associated with estimates of request runtime provided by users. This approach relaxes the strict requirement that all Advance Reservation (AR) requests associated with their respective SLAs must meet their deadlines. Two algorithms based on the SAR approach that adjust the user provided estimates for improving system performance are discussed.

,Quantifying the performance impact of overbooking virtualized resources,"Cloud services are compelling to customers from many perspectives, but the immense benefits come at a price. Along with reliability and security, performance is the Achilles heel of Cloud services. In order to make Cloud services profitable, the Cloud service provider obviously must overbook physical resources. But at what level of resource overbooking (OB) does performance begin to suffer? The answer, of course, depends on many factors. In this paper, we present a simple analytic model to quantify the performance impact of overbooking virtualized resources as a function of the relevant environment and usage parameters. We then validate those analytic modeling results against simulation, lab tests, and field data. Finally, we propose a simple means for measuring the model parameters in the field, in order to use the analytic model to determine allowable OB factors (engineering rules) while still meeting performance constraints and service-level agreements.",,2012,"Hoeflin, David & Reeser, Paul",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6364669,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Mutant Apples: A Critical Examination of Cloud SLA Availability Definitions,"The paper examines the challenges of defining and measuring availability to support real-word service comparison and dispute resolution through SLAs. We propose a rigorous and unambiguous definition of availability in cloud services. In the light of this, we show that what appear to be apples-for-apples comparisons between real-world SLAs are often based on ambiguous definitions, and even where SLAs are well defined, they differ significantly in their interpretation of availability. We show how two example real-world SLAs, would lead one service provider to report 0\% availability while another would report 100\% for the same system state history. On the basis of this, the paper concludes by arguing for the importance of standardising availability definitions and examines which elements need to be standardised and, just as importantly, which do not. Many of the results of this paper can be generalised to service level attributes other than availability: in general, such standard service definitions are a key element of a true commodity market in cloud resources, allowing service comparability before purchase, redress in the case of failure to deliver expected value and enhancing accountability in the supply chain.",,2013,"Hogben, Giles & Pannetrat, Alain",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6753821 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568486.2568551,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Application-Aware Resource Allocation for SDN-based Cloud Datacenters,"In cloud datacenters, since resource requirements change frequently, how to assign and manage resources efficiently while meeting service level agreements (SLAs) of different types of applications is an important research issue. In this paper, we propose an Application-aware Resource Allocation (App-RA) scheme to predict resource requirements and allocate an appropriate number of virtual machines (VMs) for each application in SDN-based cloud datacenters. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed App-RA is the first application-aware resource allocation scheme that adapts to all types of applications. The App-RA can meet SLAs, allocate resources efficiently, and reduce power consumption for each application in cloud datacenters. The proposed App-RA adopts the neural network based predictor to forecast the requirements of resources (CPU, Memory, GPU, Disk I/O and bandwidth) for an application. In the proposed App-RA, we have designed two algorithms which allocate appropriate numbers of virtual machines and use the VM allocation threshold to avoid SLA violations for five different types of applications. In addition, we adopt an SDN-based OpenFlow network with CICQ switches to appropriately schedule packets for different types of application in the network layer. Finally, simulation results show that the power consumption of the proposed App-RA is only 9.21\% higher than that of the best case (oracle) and the power consumption of EAACVA, which is a representative resource allocation method for non-graphic applications, is 104.58\% worse than that of App-RA.

,Migration-less Energy-Aware Task Scheduling Policies in Cloud Environments,"Burgeoning market for cloud applications has brought significant interest for cloud providers. They look for methods to maximize their profit margins by executing higher number of jobs while minimizing the operational costs and environmental footprints. Energy consumption of servers plays a crucial role in operational costs. There have been different methods to deal with energy consumption from hardware level to higher layers of abstractions such as compilers and operating systems. For example, several resource-scheduling policies have been proposed to not only regulate energy consumption but also guarantee Service Level Agreement (SLA). One of the prevalent techniques in reducing the total energy consumption in data-centers is through consolidation of virtual machines (VMs). In this technique, one or several VMs migrate from a physical node to other nodes, which in turn incurs a significant overhead not only on a server but also on the network infrastructure of a cloud. To address this problem, we propose a VM scheduling algorithm based on the unsurpassed utilization level to come up with optimal energy consumption while meeting a given QoS. In other words, our proposed algorithm aims to regulate execution speeds of VMs on a host with a result that the host works at its optimal energy level. In fact, a host is scheduled to run its allocated tasks faster to reach the optimum level of utilization instead of migrating its tasks to other hosts. We also propose several task scheduling policies to adjust execution speeds for real-time tasks in each VM. The simulation results show that the proposed task scheduling policies not only reduce the total energy consumption of a cloud by 19\%, but also have profound impacts on turnaround times of real-time tasks by 27\%.",,2014,"Hosseinimotlagh, Seyedmahyar Seyedmehdi & Khunjush, Farshad",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2634437.2635418 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6844669,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Cooperative Two-Tier Energy-Aware Scheduling for Real-Time Tasks in Computing Clouds,"Customers in a cloud would like to receive the results of their task as soon as possible while paying less. On the other hand, cloud providers aim to mitigate the operational cost of cloud environments. In other words, a limited budget makes providers create efficient cloud systems that utilize the computational powers of the clouds while minimizing their energy consumptions and environmental footprints. One of the prevalent techniques in mitigating the total energy consumptions of data-centers is through using consolidation of virtual machines (VMs). However, it incurs significant overheads on both computing resources and network infrastructure of a cloud. Furthermore, it causes tasks to be accomplished later or even it might lead to System Level Agreement (SLA) violations. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a cooperative two-tier task scheduling approach to benefit both cloud providers and their customers. It regulates the execution speeds of real-time tasks in a way that a host reaches the optimum level of utilization instead of migrating its tasks to other hosts. We also propose several predictive global task scheduling policies to map arrived tasks to feasible VMs. The simulation results show that the proposed task scheduling approach not only reduces the total energy consumption of a cloud by 41\%, but also has profound impacts on turnaround times of real-time tasks by 85\%.",,2014,"Hosseinimotlagh, Seyedmahyar Seyedmehdi & Khunjush, Farshad",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6787270 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2607054.2607425,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Auditing Cloud Service Level Agreement on VM CPU Speed,"In this paper, we present a novel scheme for auditing Service Level Agreement (SLA) in a semi-trusted or untrusted cloud. A SLA is a contract formed between a cloud service provider (CSP)and a user which specifies, in measurable terms, what resources a the CSP will provide the user. CSP's being profit based companies have incentive to cheat on the SLA. By providing a user with less resources than specified in the SLA the CSP can support more users on the same hardware and increase their profits. As the monitoring and verification of the SLA is typically performed on the cloud system itself it is straightforward for the CSP to lie on reports and hide their intentional breach of the SLA. To prevent such cheating we introduce a framework which makes use of a third party auditor (TPA). In this paper we are interested in CPU cheating only. To detect CPU cheating, we develop an algorithm which makes use of a commonly used CPU intensive calculation, transpose matrix multiplication, to randomly detect cheating by a CSP. Using real experiments we show that our algorithm can detect CPU cheating quite effectively even if the extent of the cheating is fairly small.",,2014,"Houlihan, Ryan; Du, Xiaojiang; Tan, Chiu C.; Wu, Jie & Guizani, Mohsen",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.434.3845 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6883417,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, it's more complicated to manage and guarantee quality level in the cloud than that in the telecommunication. In order to address these issues, we developed a service assurance oriented platform, Cloud BOSS, which has the capabilities of monitoring and measuring, problem management, and quality management. Every module in this platform cooperates with each other via standard JMX (Java Management Extensions) interfaces.

,An adaptive resource management scheme in cloud computing,"There are various significant issues in resource allocation, such as maximum computing performance and green computing, which have attracted researchers’ attention recently. Therefore, how to accomplish tasks with the lowest cost has become an important issue, especially considering the rate at which the resources on the Earth are being used. The goal of this research is to design a sub-optimal resource allocation system in a cloud computing environment. A prediction mechanism is realized by using support vector regressions (SVRs) to estimate the number of resource utilization according to the SLA of each process, and the resources are redistributed based on the current status of all virtual machines installed in physical machines. Notably, a resource dispatch mechanism using genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed in this study to determine the reallocation of resources. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves an effective configuration via reaching an agreement between the utilization of resources within physical machines monitored by a physical machine monitor and service level agreements (SLA) between virtual machines operators and a cloud services provider.

,The improvement of auto-scaling mechanism for distributed database - A case study for MongoDB,"In recent years, cloud computing is the most popular topic on the IT industry. The underlying virtualization technologies, that make cloud computing possible, also get more and more attention. Gradually, companies move their services to the virtual host. These services include: desktop virtualization, application virtualization and database virtualization etc. Among these services, database virtualization can improve flexibility, maximize efficiency, lower costs and ease administrative overhead. In this paper, we use on-demand features of cloud computing and sharding features of MongoDB to provide an auto-scaling database virtualization solution that satisfy the service-level agreement (SLA) requirements. First, we apply an auto-scaling mechanism of route server in the database system. The experimental results show that the average response time of auto-scaling DB solution and none-scaling DB solution are 4.3 seconds and 7.1 seconds, respectively. Second, in order to minimize the impact when moving data to a new VM, we also design a shard data migration algorithm for the database system.

,Dynamic Virtual Machine migration algorithms using enhanced energy consumption model for green cloud data centers,"Cloud data centers consume an enormous amount of energy. Virtual Machine (VM) migration technology can be applied to reduce energy consumption by consolidating VMs onto the minimal number of servers and turn idle servers into power-saving modes. While most existing energy models consider mainly computing energy, an enhanced energy consumption model is formulated, which includes energy consumption for computation, for servers to switch from standby to active modes, and for communication during VM migrations. Next, two new dynamic VM migration algorithms are proposed. They apply a local regression method to predict potentially over-utilized servers, and the 0-1 knapsack dynamic programming to find the best-fit combination of VMs for migration. The time complexity of these algorithms is analyzed, which indicates that they are highly scalable. Performance is evaluated and compared with existing algorithms. The two new heuristics have significantly reduced the number of VM migration, the number of rebooted servers, and energy consumption. Furthermore, one of them has achieved the least overall SLA violations. We believe that the new energy formulation and the two new heuristics contribute significantly towards achieving green cloud computing.",,2014,"Huang, Jing; Wu, Kai & Moh, Melody",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6903785,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Since slacking non-critical jobs can achieve significant power saving, we exploit the slack room and allocate them in a global manner in our schedule. Using random generated and real-life application workflows, our results demonstrate that EES is able to reduce considerable energy consumption while still meeting SLA.",,2012,"Huang, Qingjia; Su, Sen; Li, Jian; Xu, Peng; Shuang, Kai & Huang, Xiao",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310173 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217511,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Migration-Based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling in Cloud Data Center,"Virtualization and cloud computing technologies now make it possible to consolidate multiple online services, which are packed in Virtual Machines (VMs), into a smaller number of physical servers. However, it is still a challenging scheduling problem for cloud provider to dynamically manage the VM allocation for handling variable workloads without Service Level Agreement (SLA) violation. In this paper, we propose a Migration-based Elastic Consolidation Scheduling (MECS) mechanism to automate elastic resource scaling for cloud systems. Different from the previous researches, we take both the dynamic workload fluctuation and the VM migration overhead into account. We first develop an online resource demand predictor, which is an ARIMA-based VM resource demand state predictor, to achieve adaptive resource allocation for cloud applications. We then propose a migration-based elastic consolidation scheduling heuristic to dynamically consolidate the VMs with adaptive resource allocation for reducing the number of physical machines. Extensive experiment results show that our scheduling is able to realize elastic resource allocation with acceptable effect on SLAs.",,2013,"Huang, Qingjia; Su, Sen; Xu, Siyuan; Li, Jian; Xu, Peng & Shuang, Kai",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2570451.2570679 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6679869,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Auditing CPU Performance in Public Cloud,"Cloud computing services offer elastic computing and storage to end-users over the Internet in a pay-as-you-go way. Many businesses have started using cloud computing. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a cloud service provider (CSP) and a user is a contract that specifies the resources and performances that the cloud should provide. However, a CSP has the incentive to cheat on SLA, e.g., providing users with less CPU and memory resources than that specified in the SLA, which allows the CSP to support more users and make more profits. Unfortunately, there are no tools to allow users to verify the SLA. We study the important issue of verifying SLA in a semi-trusted (or untrusted) cloud. In this paper, we focus on the verification of CPU speed, which is an important metric in cloud SLA. We propose a lightweight stealthy test algorithm that can check if a CSP provides the CPU speed as specified in the SLA. Using real experiments, we show that the algorithm can detect cloud cheating on CPU speed (i.e., SLA violations) in a stealthy way.",,2013,"Huang, Qiang; Ye, Lin; Liu, Xinran & Du, Xiaojiang",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2552868.2552909 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6655711,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,M-convex VM Consolidation: Towards a Better VM Workload Consolidation,"Consolidating virtual machine workload is a unique feature of cloud computing platforms that greatly reduces the operating cost of the cloud data center. Correctly consolidating VMs’ workloads for a large scale cloud computing platform is nontrivial because a shortsighted scheme may save some cost in one aspect but becomes expensive in other aspects being neglected. In this paper, we present a framework that automates the VM consolidation process to improve the VMs and servers assignment whenever such improvement is possible. The proposed VM consolidation framework can achieve a balance among multiple administrative objectives (e.g., power cost, network cost) during the VM consolidation process. The solution method of solving the VM consolidation problem is designed based on the powerful and efficient semi quasi Mconvex optimization framework. The proposed algorithm can also produce VM consolidation solutions that require minimal system reconfigurations (e.g., VM migrations, turning on/off servers). More importantly, the proposed algorithm can be implemented distributedly so that the scalability of the proposed framework is greatly improved. As a result, the proposed framework is efficient, scalable and highly practical.",,2014,"Huang, Zhe & Tsang, Danny",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6953123,,SLA and Cloud
,A virtual machine consolidation framework for MapReduce enabled computing clouds,"In nowadays computing clouds, it is of the cloud providers' economic interests to correctly consolidate the workload of the virtual machines (VMs) into the suitable physical servers in the cloud data center in order to minimize the total maintenance cost. However, during the consolidation process, sufficient protection should be provided to the service level agreement (SLA) of the VMs. In this paper, the VM consolidation problem for MapReduce enabled computing clouds has been investigated. In the MapReduce enabled computing clouds, MapReduce jobs are carried out by homogeneous MapReduce VM instances that have identical hardware resource. Two resource allocation schemes with corresponding SLA constraints for the MapReduce VMs and the non-MapReduce VMs are proposed. Based on these schemes, the VM consolidation problem is modeled as an integer nonlinear optimization problem and an efficient algorithm has been proposed to locate its solutions. The results show that better VM consolidation performance can be achieved by colocating MapReduce instances together with non-MapReduce instances in the same set of physical servers.",,2012,"Huang, Zhe; Tsang, Danny H.

To optimize resource usage as low as possible while keeping user's SLA guaranteed is one of the most significant tasks. For those who use IaaS system to run their high performance applications such as communication-intensive applications, congestion of network becomes a critical problem. Sending a numerous requests to network-unaware scheduler maybe not processed due to network bottleneck while resource usage is very low.

,A Mutual Nonrepudiation Protocol for Cloud Storage with Interchangeable Accesses of a Single Account from Multiple Devices,"Obtaining mutual nonrepudiation between the user and service provider is crucial in cloud storage. One of the solutions for mutual nonrepudiation is based on logging attestations, which are signed messages. For every request, clients and service provider exchange attestations. These attestations will be used in an auditing protocol to verify their behavior. The chain-hashing scheme chains attestations and stores them in service provider for supporting write serializability and read freshness of files. However, the chain-hashing scheme is inefficient when files in an account can be accessed by multiple client devices interchangeably. In this paper we first show that the chain-hashing scheme cannot resist roll-back attack from service provider unless client devices keep all the attestations or there exists a way to broadcast the last attestation to all the client devices. We propose a scheme that can guarantee mutual nonrepudiation between the user and service provider without requiring the client devices to exchange any messages, and each client device only has to store the last attestation it received. We also propose how to apply the hash tree to remove accumulated attestations. The results from related experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.

Hybrid clouds, composing of private and public clouds, even extend research opportunities on resource selection for further complicated experiments but increase the needs of dynamic resource management to maximize its utilization. At existing public cloud providers for commercial use, rule-based and schedule-based mechanisms have been tried for automatic resource allocation to provide resources for processing dynamic workload of modern applications. However, most of the auto-scaling methods just simply support performance metric such as CPU utilization but rarely are aware of Service Level Agreements (SLA) including execution deadline or cost.

The mapping between what constitutes desirable performance and SLAs is not unique: multiple SLA expressions might be functionally equivalent. Having the flexibility to transform SLAs from one form to another in a manner that is provably safe would enable hosting solutions to achieve significant efficiencies. This paper demonstrates the promise of such an approach by proposing a type-theoretic framework for the representation and safe transformation of SLAs. Based on that framework, the paper describes a methodical approach for the inference of efficient and safe mappings of periodic, real-time tasks to the physical and virtual hosts that constitute a hierarchical scheduler. Extensive experimental results support the conclusion that the flexibility afforded by safe SLA transformations has the potential to yield significant savings.",,2011,"Ishakian, Vatche; Lapets, Andrei; Bestavros, Azer & Kfoury, Assaf",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2061037.2061198 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6012789,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Cost aware fault recovery in clouds,"Maintaining high availability of IaaS services at a reasonable cost is a challenging task that received recent attention due to the growing popularity of Cloud computing as a preferred means of affordable IT outsourcing. In large data-centers faults are prone to happen and thus the only reasonable cost-effective method of providing high availability of services is an SLA aware recovery plan; that is, a mapping of the service VMs onto backup machines where they can be executed in case of a failure. The recovery process may benefit from powering on some of these machines in advance, since redeployment on powered machines is much faster. However, this comes with an additional maintenance cost, so the real problem is how to balance between the expected recovery time improvement and the cost of machines activation. We model this problem as an offline optimization problem and present a bicriteria approximation algorithm for it. While this is the first performance guaranteed algorithm for this problem, it is somewhat complex to implement in practice. Thus, we further present a much simpler and practical heuristic based on a greedy approach. We evaluate the performance of this heuristic over real data-center data, and show that it performs well in terms of scale, hierarchical faults and variant costs. Our results indicate that our scheme can reduce the overall recovery costs by 10-15\% when compared to currently used approaches. We also show that fault recovery cost aware VM placement may farther help reducing the expected recovery costs, as it can reduce the backup machine activations costs.",,2013,"Israel, A. & Raz, D.",,,SLA and Cloud

To reach this goal, standard application formats must be enabled on the cloud to avoid vendor lock-in, and guarantees concerning protection, performance and security must be supported.

,Resource Allocation in Contending Virtualized Environments through VM Performance Modeling and Feedback,"With active deployment of virtualization in large scale data centers and cloud computing environments, allocation and scheduling of virtual and physical resources raise more challenges and may have negative impacts on system performance due to: (1) the isolation between the guest Virtual Machines (VMs) and the Virtual Machines Monitor (VMM), and (2) the independent and even conflicting operations between multiple VMs. In this paper a stochastic model of resources in virtualized environments is proposed and resource allocation and scheduling algorithm are proposed to provide performance guarantees and service differentiation in contending conditions. In the proposed algorithm user behavior and workloads are characterized through the historical and real time performance profiling and estimation from hosted agents within individual VMs. The resources are allocated according to the demand as well as the performance of the targeted VMs based on the Suffer age aggregation and performance feedback. Experiments on a real Xen based virtualization environment with 3 VMs are conducted and evaluated for accuracy, efficiency, sensitivity, and overhead. The results show that the performance feedback based allocation can achieve a higher SLA satisfaction rate as 97.5\%, a lower load imbalance index as 17.6\%. The results also show that this algorithm is valid, effective and scalable for implementation in real virtualized environments.",,2011,"Jiang, Congfeng; Xu, Xianghua; Zhang, Jilin; Li, Yunfa & Wan, Jian",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6051777 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2065356.2065606,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Guide-copy: Fast and silent migration of virtual machine for datacenters,"Cloud infrastructure providers deploy Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) to minimize the cost of datacenter operation, while maintaining the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such DRM schemes depend on the capability to migrate virtual machine (VM) images. However, existing migration techniques are not suitable for highly utilized clouds due to their latency and bandwidth critical memory transfer mechanisms. In this paper, we propose guide-copy migration, a novel VM migration scheme to provide a fast and silent migration, which works nicely under highly utilized clouds. The guide-copy migration transfers only the memory pages accessed at the destination node in the near future by running a guide version of the VM at the source node and a migrated VM at the destination node simultaneously during the migration. The guide-copy migration's highly accurate and low-bandwidth memory transfer mechanism enables a fast and silent VM migration to maintain the SLA of all VMs in the cloud.",,2013,Jihun Kim; Dongju Chae; Jangwoo Kim & Jong Kim,,,SLA and Cloud
,Towards Optimized Fine-Grained Pricing of IaaS Cloud Platform,"Although many pricing schemes in IaaS platform are already proposed with pay-as-you-go and subscription/spot market policy to guarantee service level agreement, it is still inevitable to suffer from wasteful payment because of coarsegrained pricing scheme. In this paper, we investigate an optimized fine-grained and fair pricing scheme. Two tough issues are addressed: (1) the profits of resource providers and customers often contradict mutually; (2) VM-maintenance overhead like startup cost is often too huge to be neglected. Not only can we derive an optimal price in the acceptable price range that satisfies both customers and providers simultaneously, but we also find a best-fit billing cycle to maximize social welfare (i.e., the sum of the cost reductions for all customers and the revenue gained by the provider). We carefully evaluate the proposed optimized fine-grained pricing scheme with two large-scale real-world production traces (one from Grid Workload Archive and the other from Google data center). We compare the new scheme to classic coarse-grained hourly pricing scheme in experiments and find that customers and providers can both benefit from our new approach. The maximum social welfare can be increased up to 72:98\% and 48:15\% with respect to DAS-2 trace and Google trace respectively.",,2014,"Jin, Hai; Wang, Xinhou; Wu, Song; Di, Sheng & Shi, Xuanhua",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6868291,,SLA and Cloud
,Optimal Cloud Resource Auto-Scaling for Web Applications,"In the on-demand cloud environment, web application providers have the potential to scale virtual resources up or down to achieve cost-effective outcomes. True elasticity and cost-effectiveness in the pay-per-use cloud business model, however, have not yet been achieved. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cloud resource auto-scaling scheme at the virtual machine (VM) level for web application providers. The scheme automatically predicts the number of web requests and discovers an optimal cloud resource demand with cost-latency trade-off. Based on this demand, the scheme makes a resource scaling decision that is up or down or NOP (no operation) in each time-unit re-allocation. We have implemented the scheme on the Amazon cloud platform and evaluated it using three real-world web log datasets. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves resource auto-scaling with an optimal cost-latency trade-off, as well as low SLA violations.",,2013,Jing Jiang; Jie Lu; Guangquan Zhang & Guodong Long,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546059,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Business Model for Cloud Computing Based on a Separate Encryption and Decryption Service,"Enterprises usually store data in internal storage and install firewalls to protect against intruders to access the data. They also standardize data access procedures to prevent insiders to disclose the information without permission. In cloud computing, the data will be stored in storage provided by service providers. Service providers must have a viable way to protect their clients' data, especially to prevent the data from disclosure by unauthorized insiders. Storing the data in encrypted form is a common method of information privacy protection. If a cloud system is responsible for both tasks on storage and encryption/decryption of data, the system administrators may simultaneously obtain encrypted data and decryption keys. This allows them to access information without authorization and thus poses a risk to information privacy. This study proposes a business model for cloud computing based on the concept of separating the encryption and decryption service from the storage service. Furthermore, the party responsible for the data storage system must not store data in plaintext, and the party responsible for data encryption and decryption must delete all data upon the computation on encryption or decryption is complete. A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) service is described in this paper as an example to illustrate the proposed business model. The exemplary service utilizes three cloud systems, including an encryption and decryption system, a storage system, and a CRM application system. One service provider operates the encryption and decryption system while other providers operate the storage and application systems, according to the core concept of the proposed business model. This paper further includes suggestions for a multi-party Service- Level Agreement (SLA) suitable for use in the proposed business model.",,2011,"Jing-Jang Hwang; Hung-Kai Chuang; Yi-Chang Hsu; Chien-Hsing Wu; Hwang, Jing-Jang; Chuang, Hung-Kai; Hsu, Yi-Chang & Wu, Chien-Hsing",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2057178.2057387 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5772349,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SLA enactment for large-scale healthcare workflows on multi-Cloud,"Computing Clouds offer a new way of using IT facilities including the hardware, storage, applications and networks. The huge resource pool on the Cloud forms an appropriate platform for running applications with both computing and data intensity, like the DNA sequencing workflows. This paper studies the topic of running scientific workflows on multiple Clouds, with the DNA sequencing workflow as a driven application. We focus on the problem of matching the workflow functional and non-functional Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements to the compute and storage services provisioned by underlying Clouds with different service price and quality. We designed an ontological model for a semantic description of the problem and developed a novel utility-based genetic matching algorithm for selecting the Cloud services with respect to the user requirements and the properties of the Clouds. We validated the approach by comparing the performance of the proposed algorithm with other matching algorithms in executing the DNA sequencing application on a realistic simulation platform.

,Applying Scheduling Algorithms with QoS in the Cloud Computing,"Cloud computing is the model to use existing computing resources that are delivered as a form of service over a network. These services can be divided into three parts with software, platform, and infrastructure. It is important to evaluate cloud computing environment to predict valid cost to manage the cloud computing system. SimJava and GridSim is well-known simulation tools but they do not support the virtualization of cloud computing. CloudSim is only tool which can evaluate the performance of this environment and it is based on SimJava and GridSim. It is suitable to simulate the situation with large amount of devices and data in cloud computing. Also, it can simulate the virtualization of computing nodes, network devices, and storage units. Service provider has to guarantee quality of service to provide stable related services. For this, we can use the scheduling algorithms. However, there is no consideration of data priority in CloudSim. It is important to support QoS to keep the service level agreement. Thus, it is needed to research a scheduling algorithm to support QoS.

,Towards self-caring mapreduce: Proactively reducing fault-induced execution-time penalties,"Self-Caring IT systems are those that can proactively avoid system failures rather than reactively handle failures after they have occurred. In this paper, we are interested in failures in which a MapReduce job is unable to execute within an SLA-based completion time. The existing fault tolerance capability provided by Map Reduce frameworks is simple and the penalty associated with handling failures could potentially lead to excessive job execution times. Our goal in this paper is to bring out the severity of this penalty for different job characteristics and configurable framework parameters. We first quantitatively evaluate the penalty in execution time associated with node failures in the open-source MapReduce framework, Hadoop using the MRPerf simulator. This increase in execution time is particularly expensive in pay-as-you-go cloud infrastructures where users are charged by resource usage duration. Our solution minimizes job-completion-time SLA violations by augmenting the existing fault-tolerance capability of the MapReduce framework using a dynamic resource scaling approach. This resource scaling approach leverages the elastic properties of a cloud, in order to mitigate execution time penalties and hence proactively avoids a potential job failure. Using our proposed approach for various job and framework parameters, we show that performance penalties can be decreased by up to 78\% in the case of singlenode failures and by up to 100\% in the case of 4-node failures at minimal additional cost.",,2011,"Kadirvel, Selvi & Fortes, Jose A.

,Cloud Security Issues,"In past three decades, the world of computation has changed from centralized (client-server not web-based) to distributed systems and now we are getting back to the virtual centralization (Cloud Computing). Location of data and processes makes the difference in the realm of computation. On one hand, an individual has full control on data and processes in his/her computer. On the other hand, we have the cloud computing wherein, the service and data maintenance is provided by some vendor which leaves the client/customer unaware of where the processes are running or where the data is stored. So, logically speaking, the client has no control over it. The cloud computing uses the internet as the communication media. When we look at the security of data in the cloud computing, the vendor has to provide some assurance in service level agreements (SLA) to convince the customer on security issues. Organizations use cloud computing as a service infrastructure, critically like to examine the security and confidentiality issues for their business critical insensitive applications. Yet, guaranteeing the security of corporate data in the ""cloud"" is difficult, if not impossible, as they provide different services like Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Each service has their own security issues. So the SLA has to describe different levels of security and their complexity based on the services to make the customer understand the security policies that are being implemented. There has to be a standardized way to prepare the SLA irrespective to the providers. This can help some of the enterprises to look forward in using the cloud services.

However the resources available in a single datacenter are limited. Thus if a large demand is observed in a given time, a cloud provider is not able to deliver a uniform QoS. To avoid this scenario, I enable the application to scale it across multiple independent cloud datacenters by forming federated clouds. In such a case, from the customer's point of view it is always difficult to decide whose resources they should use. To handle this case a ranking mechanism is proposed which measures the quality and prioritize the cloud resources.

Therefore, this research explores the utility function of the SLA and uses an approach for the optimal selection of a multi-tenancy service based on a SLA utility function. The approach formalizes the SLA and discusses a utility model for the SLA's configuration items. Then, the multi-criteria decision analysis method is used to discover the reasonable selection order of multi-tenancy services.

,Facilitating Self-Adaptable Inter-cloud Management,"Cloud Computing infrastructures have been developed as individual islands, and mostly proprietary solutions so far. However, as more and more infrastructure providers apply the technology, users face the inevitable question of using multiple infrastructures in parallel. Federated cloud management systems offer a simplified use of these infrastructures by hiding their proprietary solutions. As the infrastructure becomes more complex underneath these systems, the situations (like system failures, handling of load peaks and slopes) that users cannot easily handle, occur more and more frequently. Therefore, federations need to manage these situations autonomously without user interactions. This paper introduces a methodology to autonomously operate cloud federations by controlling their behavior with the help of knowledge management systems. Such systems do not only suggest reactive actions to comply with established Service Level Agreements (SLA) between provider and consumer, but they also find a balance between the fulfillment of established SLAs and resource consumption. The paper adopts rule-based techniques as its knowledge management solution and provides an extensible rule set for federated clouds built on top of multiple infrastructures.",,2012,"Kecskemeti, G.; Maurer, M.; Brandic, I.; Kertesz, A.; Nemeth, Zs.; Dustdar, S. & Br, I.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2195223.2195827 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.259.8837 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6169643,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Ice concentrations estimated from texture classified ERS-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images by assigning experience-based ice concentrations to ice-type classes are overestimated by SLA and ASI ice concentrations by 4.4\% and 1.5\% (correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.77). However, omitting low/high ice concentrations forming up to 80\% (AVHRR) and 60\% (SAR) of the entire dataset reveals a significantly different statistic. For instance, the correlation between AVHRR and SLA and ASI ice concentrations drops to 0.77 and 0.70, respectively. All presented techniques to obtain ice concentrations need improvement and future developments should involve larger datasets.

,An interoperable and self-adaptive approach for SLA-based service virtualization in heterogeneous Cloud environments,"Cloud computing is a newly emerged computing infrastructure that builds on the latest achievements of diverse research areas, such as Grid computing, Service-oriented computing, business process management and virtualization. An important characteristic of Cloud-based services is the provision of non-functional guarantees in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), such as guarantees on execution time or price. However, due to system malfunctions, changing workload conditions, hard- and software failures, established SLAs can be violated. In order to avoid costly SLA violations, flexible and adaptive SLA attainment strategies are needed. In this paper we present a self-manageable architecture for SLA-based service virtualization that provides a way to ease interoperable service executions in a diverse, heterogeneous, distributed and virtualized world of services.

,A multi-start local search heuristic for an energy efficient VMs assignment on top of the OpenNebula cloud manager,"Reducing energy consumption is an increasingly important issue in cloud computing, more specifically when dealing with a large-scale cloud. Minimizing energy consumption can significantly reduce the amount of energy bills and the greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, many researches are carried out to develop new methods in order to consume less energy. In this paper, we present an Energy-aware Multi-start Local Search algorithm (EMLS-ONC) that optimizes the energy consumption of an OpenNebula-based Cloud. Moreover, we propose a Pareto Multi-Objective version of the EMLS-ONC called EMLS-ONC-MO dealing with both the energy consumption and the Service Level Agreement (SLA). The objective is to find a Pareto tradeoff between reducing the energy consumption of the cloud while preserving the performance of Virtual Machines (VMs). The different schedulers have been experimented using different arrival scenarios of VMs and different hardware configurations (artificial and real). The results show that EMLS-ONC and EMLS-ONC-MO outperform the other energy- and performance-aware algorithms in addition to the one provided in OpenNebula by a significant margin on the considered criteria.

In such a service driven environment it is very important that resource provisioning can be optimized and users and applications have some level of assurance that their requirements can be satisfied. However, in order to guarantee a certain level of Quality of Service (QoS) Service Level Agreements (SLA) which specify contracts between providers and users are commonly used. This paper aims to investigate the QoS issues and SLA management within Cloud Computing and to present a framework for QoS assurance.",,2012,"Khaddaj, S.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6385269 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2416643.2417200,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Cloud computing architectures based multi-tenant IDS,"Cloud computing is less expensive than traditional on-premise computing for users, as it provides accessibility and reliability options for users and scalable sales for provider. But, like most things in life, the benefits come with risks. It's just a matter of knowing if the benefits outweigh the risks and vice versa. Unfortunately, the cloud computing does not escape to this universal rule. Then, it is important to consider the security of the cloud. As a solution to protect the cloud from security issues [1, 2, 3, 4], we think that IDSs integrated in the cloud remains among the best solution. We will also present an architecture based IDS that respects multi-tenancy architecture. The objective behind integrating multi-tenancy aspect in our solution is to give tenants the ability to configure some parts of the application, such as the color of the user interface or business rules, but they can't customize the application's code. This means that although tenants an using the same building blocks in their configuration, the appearance or workflow of the application may be different for two tenants. Also, the Service Level Agreement (SLA) of each tenant can differ. In fact, we contend that multi-tenancy is a requirement for any cloud architecture because of four key benefits. First, High security: there are 3 key components that define the degree of isolation between multiple tenants in a data center: access policies, application deployment and data access and protection. Second, Economy: software development and maintenance costs are shared between the tenants. Third, Service assurance and faster updates: with multi-tenancy, the provider has to make updates once. In contrast with single-tenancy, an architecture in which each customer has their own software instance and may be given access to application code. Fourth, Efficiency and flexibility: A SaaS provider can run one instance of its application on one instance of a database and provide web access to multipl- customers. Each tenant's data is Isolated and remains invisible to other tenants [11].",,2013,"Khalil, Elmahdi; Enniari, Saad & Zbakh, Mostapha",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6595469,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A new approach for optimum resource utilization in cloud computing environments,A key issue in cloud computing environments is to maximize profit by accepting all incoming requests and to minimize SLA violation that causes penalty for cloud providers. Achieving these goals highly depends on optimum usage of available resources in data-centers. So far other works have focused on provisioning QoS in the cloud. In this work as an alternative to others we describe shortcomings caused by the lack of resource management mechanism and propose a mathematical model for this issue to better describe it. Then we propose a heuristic algorithm to improve resource management and finally we use fuzzy systems to apply our expertise knowledge to solve the problem. Experimental results on eucalyptus as a private cloud shows that proposed algorithms with suitable management of resources result in an increment of profit by reducing rejected requests of the cloud.,,2011,"Khoshdel, Vahid; Motamedi, Seyed Ahmad; Sharifian, Saeed & Farhadi, Masoud",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6413371,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Prediction models for long-term Internet prefix availability,"The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) maintains inter-domain routing information by announcing and withdrawing IP prefixes. These routing updates can cause prefixes to be unreachable for periods of time, reducing prefix availability observed from different vantage points on the Internet. The observed prefix availability values may not meet the standards promised by Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we develop a framework for predicting long-term availability of prefixes, given short-duration prefix information from publicly available BGP routing databases like RouteViews, and prediction models constructed from information about other Internet prefixes. We compare three prediction models and find that machine learning-based prediction methods outperform a baseline model that predicts the future availability of a prefix to be the same as its past availability. Our results show that mean time to failure is the most important attribute for predicting availability. We also quantify how prefix availability is related to prefix length and update frequency. Our prediction models achieve 82\% accuracy and 0.7 ranking quality when predicting for a future duration equal to the learning duration. We can also predict for a longer future duration, with graceful performance reduction. Our models allow ISPs to adjust BGP routing policies if predicted availability is low, and are generally useful for cloud computing systems, content distribution networks, P2P, and VoIP applications.",,2011,"Khosla, Ravish; Fahmy, Sonia; Hu, Y.

Thus, it is significant to analyze the effect of failure in Cloud systems to performance.

,Group-based memory oversubscription for virtualized clouds,"As memory resource is a primary inhibitor of oversubscribing data centers in virtualized clouds, efficient memory management has been more appealing to public cloud providers. Although memory oversubscription improves overall memory efficiency, existing schemes lack isolation support, which is crucial for clouds to provide pay-per-use services on multi-tenant resource pools. This paper presents group-based memory oversubscription that confines both mechanism and policy of memory oversubscription into a group of virtual machines. A group is specified as one of service level agreements so that a cloud customer can control the memory management mechanism within its own isolated domain. We introduce group-based memory deduplication and reprovisioning with several policies based on per-group workload behaviors. The proposed scheme is implemented on the KVM-based prototype and evaluated with realistic cloud workloads such as MapReduce and MPI applications. The evaluation results show that our group-based memory oversubscription ensures strict inter-group isolation while achieving intra-group memory efficiency, compared to a system-wide scheme, by adapting oversubscription policies based on per-group workload characteristics.",,2014,"Kim, Sangwook; Kim, Hwanju; Lee, Joonwon & Jeong, Jinkyu",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743731514000033,,SLA and Cloud

,Assuring Data Privacy in Cloud Transformations,"Cloud transformations require dynamic redistribution of resources across cloud infrastructure. From a legal perspective this movement of data from one data processor to another without the explicit consent of the data subject is a threat to data privacy. Levels of assurance and accountability have to be provided from the cloud infrastructure providers to the data subject in order to maintain trust. In cases of Cloud Transformation multiple providers are present and passing accountability down the chain is essential. Existing Service Level Agreements (SLA) and policy based privacy implementations fail to provide the flexibility and accountability needed in establishing these new relationships. By introducing combined risk and privacy assessment alongside SLA negotiation, the legal and data management implications of Cloud Transformation events can be better accounted for. This will better protect the privacy of data subjects and increase confidence and trust in the Cloud computing platform.",,2012,"Kirkham, Tom; Armstrong, Django; Djemame, Karim; Corrales, Marcelo; Kiran, Mariam; Nwankwo, Iheanyi; Jiang, Ming & Forgo, Nikolaus",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2360018.2360151 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6296092,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,An energy-efficient approach for virtual machine placement in cloud based data centers,"Cloud computing is a new technology which is proffering IT services based on pay-as-you-go model to consumers from everywhere in the world. The growing demand of Cloud infrastructure and modern computational requests like business, scientific and web applications result in large-scale data centers and lead to extra electrical energy consumption. High energy consumption causes high operational cost and also led to high carbon emission which is harmful for atmosphere. Hence, energy-efficient techniques are required to minimize the negative effects of Cloud computing on the environment. Virtual machines (VMs) migration, dynamic consolidation in the virtualized data centers in cloud environments and switching idle physical machines off could yield reduce energy consumption; hence, one of the important issues for energy efficiency in virtualized cloud environments is how to place new VMs or selected VMs for migration across the hosts. In this paper we propose an energy-efficient approach based on Minimum Correlation Coefficient (MCC) method for virtual machine placement in cloud based, virtualized data centers. The proposed approach regards both Service Level Agreement (SLA) and low energy consumption and tries to make a trade-off between these two concerns using fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).

,SLA-driven capacity planning for Cloud applications,"Cloud computing paradigm has become the solution to provide good service quality and exploit economies of scale. However, the management of such elastic resources, with different Quality-of-Service (QoS) combined with on-demand self-service, is a complex issue. This paper proposes an approach driven by Service Level Agreement (SLA) for optimizing the capacity planning for Cloud applications. The main challenge for a service provider is to determine the best trade-off between profit and customer satisfaction. In order to address this issue, we follow a queueing network proposal and present an analytical performance model to predict Cloud service performance. Based on a utility function and a capacity planning method, our solution calculates the optimal configuration of a Cloud application. We rely on autonomic computing to adjust continuously the configuration. Simulation experiments indicate that our model i) faithfully captures the performance of Cloud applications for a number of workloads and configurations and ii) successfully keeps the best trade-off.",,2012,"Kouki, Yousri & Ledoux, Thomas",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6427519 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2469226.2469265,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Cross-layer SLA Selection for Cloud Services,"Cloud computing is a paradigm for enabling remote, on-demand access to a set of configurable computing resources as a service. The pay-per-use model enables service providers to offer their services to customers in different Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels. These QoS parameters are used to compose some bipartisan Service Level Agreement (SLA) between a service provider and a service consumer. A main challenge for a service provider is to manage SLAs for its service consumers, i.e. automatically determine the appropriate resources required from the lower layer in order to respect the QoS requirements of his consumers. This paper proposes an optimization framework driven by consumer preferences to address the SLA dependencies problem across the different cloud layers as well as the need of flexibility and dynamicity required by the domain of Cloud computing. Our approach aims to select the optimal vertical business process designed by cross-layer cloud services, enforcing SLA dependencies between layers. Based on Constraint Programming (CP), our approach can take into account dynamic QoS parameters in a flexible manner to compose the best vertical business process. Experimental results demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our approach.",,2011,"Kouki, Yousri; Ledoux, Thomas & Sharrock, Remi",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2120958.2121096 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6123452,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Language Support for Cloud Elasticity Management,"Elasticity is the intrinsic element that differentiates Cloud computing from traditional computing paradigm, since it allows service providers to rapidly adjust their needs for resources to absorb the demand and hence guarantee a minimum level of Quality of Service (QoS) that respects the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) previously defined with their clients. However, due to non-negligible resource initiation time, network fluctuations or unpredictable workload, it becomes hard to guarantee QoS levels and SLA violations may occur. This paper proposes a language support for Cloud elasticity management that relies on CSLA (Cloud Service Level Agreement). CSLA offers new features such as QoS/functionality degradation and an advanced penalty model that allow providers to finely express contracts so that services self-adaptation capabilities are improved and SLA violations minimized. The approach was evaluated with a real infrastructure and application test bed. Experimental results show that the use of CSLA makes Cloud services capable of absorbing more peaks and oscillations by trading-off the QoS levels and costs due to penalties.",,2014,"Kouki, Yousri; de Oliveira, Frederico Alvares; Dupont, Simon & Ledoux, Thomas",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846456,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Translation of Application-level Terms to Resourcelevel attributes across the Cloud Stack Layers,"The emergence of new environments such as Cloud computing highlighted new challenges in traditional fields like performance estimation. Most of the current cloud environments follow the Software, Platform, Infrastructure service model in order to map discrete roles / providers according to the offering in each “layer”. However, the limited amount of information passed from one layer to the other has raised the level of difficulty in translating user-understandable application terms from the Software layer to resource specific attributes, which can be used to manage resources in the Platform and Infrastructure layers. In this paper, a generic black box approach, based on Artificial Neural Networks is used in order to perform the aforementioned translation. The efficiency of the approach is presented and validated through different application scenarios (namely FFMPEG encoding and real-time interactive e-Learning) that highlight its applicability even in cases where accurate performance estimation is critical, as in cloud environments aiming to facilitate real-time and interactivity.",,2011,"Kousiouris, George; Kyriazis, Dimosthenis; Gogouvitis, Spyridon; Menychtas, Andreas; Konstanteli, Kleopatra & Varvarigou, Theodora",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.301.6886 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5984009,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,"Dynamic, behavioral-based estimation of resource provisioning based on high-level application terms in Cloud platforms","Delivering Internet-scale services and IT-enabled capabilities as computing utilities has been made feasible through the emergence of Cloud environments. While current approaches address a number of challenges such as quality of service, live migration and fault tolerance, which is of increasing importance, refers to the embedding of users’ and applications’ behaviour in the management processes of Clouds. The latter will allow for accurate estimation of the resource provision (for certain levels of service quality) with respect to the anticipated users’ and applications’ requirements. In this paper we present a two-level generic black-box approach for behavioral-based management across the Cloud layers (i.e., Software, Platform, Infrastructure): it provides estimates for resource attributes at a low level by analyzing information at a high level related to application terms (Translation level) while it predicts the anticipated user behaviour (Behavioral level). Patterns in high-level information are identified through a time series analysis, and are afterwards translated to low-level resource attributes with the use of Artificial Neural Networks. We demonstrate the added value and effectiveness of the Translation level through different application scenarios: namely FFMPEG encoding, real-time interactive e-Learning and a Wikipedia-type server.

,Resource Usage Control in Multi-tenant Applications,"Multi-tenancy is an approach to share one application instance among multiple customers by providing each of them a dedicated view. This approach is commonly used by SaaS providers to reduce the costs for service provisioning. Tenants also expect to be isolated in terms of the performance they observe and the providers inability to offer performance guarantees is a major obstacle for potential cloud customers. To guarantee an isolated performance it is essential to control the resources used by a tenant. This is a challenge, because the layers of the execution environment, responsible for controlling resource usage(e.g., operating system), normally do not have knowledge about entities defined at the application level and thus they cannot distinguish between different tenants. Furthermore, it is hard to predict how tenant requests propagate through the multiple layers of the execution environment down to the physical resource layer. The intended abstraction of the application from the resource controlling layers does not allow to solely solving this problem in the application. In this paper, we propose an approach which applies resource demand estimation techniques in combination with a request based admission control. The resource demand estimation is used to determine resource consumption information for individual requests. The admission control mechanism uses this knowledge to delay requests originating from tenants that exceed their allocated resource share. The proposed method is validated by a widely accepted benchmark showing its applicability in a setup motivated by today's platform environments.",,2014,"Krebs, Rouven; Spinner, Simon; Ahmed, Nadia & Kounev, Samuel",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846447,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Flying over Mobile Clouds with Security Planes: Select Your Class of SLA for End-to-End Security,"End-to-end security is one of the biggest challenges for mobile clouds today: mobile cloud computing may mean the worst of cloud and device worlds regarding threats. Unfortunately, previous solutions considered the problem from one end only, lacking device-to-cloud virtual organizations (VOrgs), end-to-end VOrg isolation, and automated security supervision. This paper presents Orange MC2, a new security architecture and implementation overcoming such limitations. For homogeneous security SLA guarantees, execution environments in device and cloud domains are dynamically set up into VOrgs called MC2s, forming end-to-end security planes over the infrastructure.

,SLA management and service composition of virtualized applications in mobile networking environments,"Cloud computing is a promising solution for the flexible, on-demand delivery of communication services and infrastructures. The European Union funded project Mobile Cloud Networking is developing a cloud-based mobile communication service platform where service providers deliver virtualized wireless infrastructures integrated with high-level applications running on top of them. Mobile networks are redesigned, placed upon and operated on cloud computing platforms. These then are available with the on-demand, elastic and pay-as-you-go characteristics derived from the cloud principles. In this platform, a variety of services including heterogeneous radio networking, federated computing resources, virtualized network functions, support services and high-level applications are automatically and seamlessly orchestrated in composite end-to-end services delivered to enterprise end-users. The management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for these cloud-based composite services requires a dedicated framework to combine and jointly manage the multiple SLAs associated to the different service components. This paper presents an architecture for the enforcement and validation of SLAs for mobile cloud services, discussing its positioning in the overall mobile cloud networking platform and its role across the different phases of the service lifecycle.",,2014,"Landi, Giada; Neves, Pedro Miguel; Edmonds, Andy; Metsch, Thijs; Mueller, Julius & Crosta, Paolo Secondo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6838413,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Design Space for Dynamic Service Level Agreements in OpenStack,"This paper develops a research and development plan for dynamic service level agreements (SLAs) in Open Stack to support cloud applications that may have changing resources requirements. The fundamental SLA functions are reviewed: Admission Control, Monitoring, SLA Evaluation, and SLA Enforcement - a classic autonomic control cycle. We then identify five basic Load Types that a dynamic SLA system must manage: Best Effort, Throttled, Load Migration, Preemption and Spare Capacity. The key to meeting application SLA requirements under changing surge conditions is to also manage the spare surge capacity. The use of this surge capacity could be managed by one of several identified load migration policies. A more detailed SLA architecture for Open Stack is presented that discusses specific SLA components that would need to be developed for an end-to-end, dynamic SLA capability. Based on this architecture, a research and development plan is presented. Cloud SLAs and cloud performance management are important topics in the wider cloud marketplace.

,Load-Balancing Tactics in Cloud,"Cloud computing enables shared servers to provide resources, software and data for collaborative services on demand with high interoperability and scalability. However, there are a number of technical challenges that need to be tackled before these benefits can be fully realized, which include system reliability, resource provisioning, and efficient resources consuming, etc. Among them, load-balancing is a necessary mechanism to increase the service level agreement (SLA) and better uses of the resources. Unfortunately, servers' capability varies much in practice and is not easy to record in ordered positions in a server farm, which will causes non resource-aware load-balancing algorithms to distribute workloads evenly. We discuss this issue and show why such algorithms don't fit the cloud computing environment and then present a feasible resource-aware load balancing mechanism by using existing proven technologies to meet higher SLA and the return of investment as well.",,2011,"Lee, Rich & Jeng, Bingchiang",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2082756.2083323 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6079471,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

To assure the quality of service and effectiveness of Enterprise Cloud Computing, a middleware to support the service composition and monitoring in Enterprise Cloud Computing is highly important. We have designed a middleware for Enterprise Cloud Computing which can automatically manage the resource allocation of services from services, platforms, and infrastructures, and provide a cost-effective and secure way to access services from cloud environment. This architecture will compose of several functions, such as Service Monitoring, Service Composition, and Service Status Analysis. In order to provide complete transparency of the underlying technology and the surrounding environment, thus easy for management and testing, the architecture we proposed in this paper employs the agent technology to handle the monitoring of requested Quality of Service requirements and Service Level Agreement, which are capable to support the Verification and Validation, and, furthermore, to dynamically analyze resources allocation and deployment.",,2012,"Lee, Shou-Yu; Tang, Dongyang; Chen, Tingchao & Chu, William Cheng-Chung",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6341595 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2408860.2410035,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Optimization of cloud resource subscription policy,"In recent years, cloud computing has become a promising solution for decreasing the deployment and maintenance costs of Internet services. To provide Internet application service by using cloud resource, a service provider needs to consider the resource subscription cost and Service Level Agreement (SLA) of its users. Several kinds of pricing model of cloud resource subscription have been proposed. In such case, the Internet service provider plays the role of a cloud customer with a need of optimal cloud resource subscription policy to reduce its operation cost. Therefore, how to determine a suitable policy of cloud resource subscription has become a challenging issue. In this work, we proposed a two-phase approach to solve the cloud resource subscription problem. The first phase considered long-term resource reservation. In this phase, we proposed a mathematic model to compute an upper bound of the optimal amount of long-term reserved resource. The second phase was dynamic resource subscription phase. In order to overcome dynamic resource demand, in this phase, we used Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to predict resource demand and allocate VM resource adaptively based on the prediction. We evaluated our solution using real-world resource demand data. Our numerical results indicated that our approach can reduce the cost of cloud resource subscription significantly.",,2012,"Lee, Wei-Ru; Teng, Hung-Yi & Hwang, Ren-Hung",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2469226.2469349 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6427490,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Service Level Agreement for Distributed Mutual Exclusion in Cloud Computing,"In Cloud Computing, Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract that defines a level and a type of QoS between a cloud provider and a client. Since applications in a Cloud share resources, we propose two tree-based distributed mutual exclusion algorithms that support the SLA concept. The first one is a modified version of the priority-based Kanrar-Chaki algorithm [1] while the second one is a novel algorithm, based on Raymond algorithm [2], where a deadline is associated with every request. In both cases, our aim is to improve Critical Section execution rate and to reduce the number of SLA violations, which, for the first algorithm represents the number of priority inversions (i.e. a higher priority request is satisfied after a lower one) and for the second one, the number of requests whose deadline is not respected. Performance evaluation results show that our solutions significantly reduce SLA violations avoiding message overhead.",,2012,"Lejeune, Jonathan; Arantes, Luciana; Sopena, Julien & Sens, Pierre",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6217420 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2310096.2310156,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Security Risk Assessment of Cloud Carrier,"Cloud computing based delivery model has been adopted by end-users and enterprises to reduce IT costs and complexities. The ability to offload user software and data to cloud data centers has raised many security and privacy concerns over the cloud computing model. Significant research efforts have focused on hyper visor security and low-layer operating system implementations in cloud data centers. Unfortunately, the role of cloud carrier in the security and privacy of user software and data has not been well studied. Cloud carrier represents the wide area network that provides the connectivity and transport of cloud services between cloud consumers and cloud providers. In this paper, we present a risk assessment framework to study the security risk of the cloud carrier between cloud consumers and cloud providers. The risk assessment framework leverages the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) to examine the security vulnerabilities of operating systems of routers within the cloud carrier. This framework provides quantifiable security metrics for cloud carrier, which enables cloud consumers to establish the quality of security services among cloud providers. Such security metric information is very useful in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) negotiation between a cloud consumer and a cloud provider. It can be also be used to build a tool to verify SLA compliance. Furthermore, we implement this framework for the cloud carriers of Amazon Web Services and Windows Azure Platform. Our experiments show that the security risks of cloud carriers on these two commercial clouds are significantly different. This finding provides guidance for a network provider to improve the security of cloud carriers.",,2013,"Lenkala, S.

,Exploiting Performance and Cost Diversity in the Cloud,"Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms, such as Amazon EC2, allow clients access to massive computational power in the form of virtual machines (VMs) known as instances. Amazon hosts three different instance purchasing options, each with its own service level agreement covering availability and pricing. In addition, Amazon offers access to a number of geographical regions, zones, and instance types from which to select. In this paper, we present a resource allocation and job scheduling framework (RAMC-DC), which utilizes Amazon's rich selection of service offerings---particularly within Spot and On-Demand instance purchasing options---aiming to cost efficiently execute deadline-constrained jobs. The framework is capable of ensuring quality of service in terms of cost, deadline compliance and service reliability. Such capacities are realized incorporating a set of novel strategies including execution time and cost approximation, bidding and resource allocation strategies. To the best of our knowledge, RAMC-DC most extensively exploits the service diversity of Amazon EC2, and offers a comprehensive cost efficiency solution that is able to deliver both the performance and reliability of On-Demand instances and the low costs of Spot instances. Experimental results obtained from extensive simulations using Amazon's Spot price traces show that our approach keeps deadline breaches and early-termination rates as low as 0.47\% and 0.18\%, respectively. This reliable performance is achieved with total costs between 13\% and 20\% of an equivalent approach using only On-Demand instances.",,2013,"Leslie, Luke M. & Zomaya, Albert Y.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6676684 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2514940.2515021,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,RDCM: Reliable Data Center Multicast,"Multicast benefits data center group communication in both saving network traffic and improving application throughput. The SLA (Service Level Agreement) of cloud service requires the computation correctness of distributed applications, translating to the requirement of reliable Multicast delivery. In this paper we present RDCM, a novel reliable Multicast approach for data center network. The key idea of RDCM is to minimize the impact of packet loss on the Multicast performance, by leveraging the rich link resource in data centers. A Multicast-tree-aware backup overlay is purposely built on group members for peer-to-peer packet repair. Riding on Unicast, packet repair not only achieves complete repair isolation, but also has high probability to bypass the pathological links in the Multicast tree where packet loss occurs. The backup overlay is organized in such a way that it causes little individual repair burden, control overhead, as well as overall repair traffic. We have implemented RDCM as a user-level library on Windows platform. The experiments on our test bed show that RDCM handles packet loss without obvious throughput degradation during high-speed data transmission.",,2011,"Li, Dan; Xu, Mingwei; Zhao, Ming-chen; Guo, Chuanxiong; Zhang, Yongguang & Wu, Min-you",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5935228 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.231.4611,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Interactive multimedia content-driven applications in the domains of healthcare, aged-care, and education have emerged as one of the new classes of big data applications. This new generation of applications need to support complex content operations including production, deployment, consumption, personalization, and distribution. However, to efficiently provision these applications on the Cloud data centres, there is a need to understand their runtime resource configurations. For example: (i) where to store and distribute the content to and from driven by end-user Service Level Agreements (SLAs)? (ii) How many content distribution servers to provision? And (iii) what Cloud VM configuration (number of instances, types, speed, etc.) to provision? In this paper, we present concepts and factors related to engineering such content-driven applications over public Clouds.

,Ontology-based Negotiation of security requirements in cloud,"The Cloud Computing paradigm attracts many customers because of the potentialities it promises. Despite of many benefits, a widespread adoption is limited by many issues that potential customers still have to face. Security in the cloud is one of the main concern for the customer. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) is responsible of providing security to customers and assuring that their data and application are properly secured. In this context, the concept of Service Level Agreement (SLA) assumes a great importance. It can be used as a means to formalize and establish in a contract what must effectively be granted in terms of security levels. There is actually Semantic Gap between how security guarantees are intended respectively by customers and providers. A customer is inclined to express security in terms of high-level requirements, while a CSP expresses guarantees through a technical, low-level language. To address this gap, the key is to find a common language for both the customer and the CSP. The goal of this paper is to offer an Ontology-based Negotiation Service allowing a customer to negotiate the interested security level among different CSPs, with the possibility to choose the best security offering; a Security Ontology was developed as a basis for a common semantic language that customers and providers will have to use to express security features and requirements.",,2012,"Liccardo, Loredana; Rak, Massimiliano; Di Modica, Giuseppe & Tomarchio, Orazio",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6412401,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Resource management techniques for handling requests with service level agreements,"The prominence of cloud computing that provides resources on demand to various types of users including enterprises as well as engineering and scientific institutions is growing rapidly. An effective resource management middleware is necessary to harness the power of the underlying distributed hardware in a cloud. The resource manager needs to be able to effectively perform mapping (matchmaking and scheduling) of user requests (jobs) on to resources to satisfy desired system objectives as well as user's requirements for a quality of service that is often captured in a service level agreement (SLA). This paper concerns the problem of meeting an end-to-end SLA (characterized by an earliest start time, an execution time, and a deadline) for applications that require service from multiple resources (referred to as multi-stage applications) on a system subjected to an open stream of request arrivals. A new budget-based algorithm and a resource manager called MapReduce Budget-based Resource Manager (MRBB-RM) are devised for effectively performing matchmaking and scheduling of an open stream of MapReduce jobs (a popular multi-stage application) with SLAs on a distributed environment such as a cloud or a cluster.

,Verifying cloud Service Level Agreement,"In this paper we study the important issue of verifying Service Level Agreement (SLA) in a semi-trusted (or untrusted) cloud. Cloud computing services promise elastic computing and storage resources in a pay-as-you-go way. A SLA between a cloud service provider (CSP) and a user is a contract which specifies the resources and performances that the cloud should offer. However, the CSP has the incentive to cheat on SLA, e.g., providing users with less CPU and memory resources than that specified in the SLA, which allows the CSP to support more users and make more profits. A malicious CSP can disrupt the existing SLA monitoring/verification techniques by interfering the monitoring/measurement process. Therefore, we present a SLA verification framework that leverages a third party auditor (TPA). Under the TPA framework, we propose an effective testing algorithm that can detect SLA violations of physical memory size in virtual machine (VM). Using real experiments, we show that the algorithm can detect cloud cheating on VM memory size (i.e., SLA violations). Furthermore, our algorithm can defend various attacks from a malicious CSP, which tries to hide a SLA violation.",,2012,Lin Ye; Hongli Zhang; Jiantao Shi & Xiaojiang Du,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6503207,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Modelling cloud data for prototype manufacturing,"In this paper, the authors have developed a novel method to integrate reverse engineering (RE) and rapid prototyping (RP). Unorganised cloud data are directly sliced and modelled with two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections. Based on such a 2D CAD model, the data points are directly converted into RP slice data and fed to an RP machine for fabricating. In this process, neither a surface model nor a STL file is generated. This is accomplished from the 3D data points in several steps: first, the cloud data are sliced into a number of layers along a user-specified direction. The points in each layer are projected onto a plane. Secondly, the points on each plane are sorted and compressed. Data point smoothing is then carried out using a discrete curvature based method. Thirdly, a local interpolating method is used for adding additional points to the slice-lines having insufficient points. Fourthly, the cross-sections between every two neighbouring planes are created by directly connecting the feature points (FPs) with straight-line segments.

Based on this fact, a SLA-based Service Composition Model with Semantic Support (SSCMSS) is proposed in this paper. First, a SLA management ontology model is built to provide semantic support. And then the framework composes the SLAs of different services to get an integrated service quality level based on the composition pattern.

Requirements and challenges, including performance, scalability, SLA management, security, network optimization, and unified management are discussed, and key technologies are figured out accordingly. Cost effective hardware and software configuration, distributed infrastructure deployment model as well as operation process are proposed, and end user experience of cloud based applications such as online game, high definition video will benefit from low latency and high bandwidth of back bone and service delivery network owned by operators.",,2012,"Liu, Kevin",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6356069,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,DMSS: A Dynamic Memory Scheduling System in Server Consolidation Environments,"As the foundation of cloud computing, Server consolidation allows multiple computer infrastructures running as virtual machines in a single physical node. It improves the utilization of most kinds of resource but memory under x86 architecture. Because of inaccurate memory usage estimate and the lack of memory resource management, there is much service performance degradation in data centers, even though they have occupied a large amount of memory. Furthermore, memory becomes insufficient for a physical server when a lot of virtual machines depend on it. In order to improve this, we present a dynamic memory scheduling system called DMSS, which can manage memory resources in server consolidation environments and allocate memory among virtual machines on demand. We have designed and implemented the corresponding memory scheduling policy based on Xen virtualization platform to enhance memory efficiency and achieve service level agreement. The benchmark shows that DMSS can make an accurate and rapid response to memory changes and save more than 30\% physical memory with less than 5\% performance degradation. DMSS actually brings in economic benefits to cloud service providers because more virtual machines can be accommodated at lower costs.",,2012,"Liu, Lanzheng; Chu, Rui; Zhu, Yongchun; Zhang, Pengfei & Wang, Liufeng",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2224477.2224628 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6196105,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,SLA-Driven Resource Provisioning in the Cloud,"The common way to purchase computing capacity is to acquire a fix amount of servers which are hosted in a data center. The reserved amount of resources depends on the maximum demand that could occur. This over provisioning of resources is associated with high costs. Cloud providers promise to reduce the costs while guaranteeing always a good performance for the outsourced services. A reducing of the costs can be achieved by a better utilization of the resources for example. To optimize resource utilization while complying to the negotiated Service Level Agreements, the minimum amount of resources has to be determined as exactly as possible. Based on the simulated reprocessing of requests from recent history with different numbers of instances, the optimal number can be found in a short time. Further this work shows that an additional reduction of resources can be achieved by rescheduling the requests before processing.",,2011,"Lodde, Andreas; Schlechter, Antoine; Bauler, Pascal & Feltz, Fernand",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6123434 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2120958.2121078,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Air temperature and soil phosphorus availability correlate with trait differences between two types of tropical cloud forests,"Tropical cloud forests are characterized by lower air temperature and high frequency of fog condensation at canopy level, as compared with forests at lower altitudes. Few studies have been conducted to understand differences of plant functional traits in relation to the environment in this kind of forest. In this paper, we explored the community-level differences of specific leaf area (SLA) and height of plants in relation to major environmental conditions between two adjacent tropical cloud forests on Hainan Island, South China. We measured the two functional traits for all individual plants within twenty-nine and thirty-two 10m×10m plots located in a low altitude tropical montane evergreen forest (TMEF) and a high altitude tropical dwarf forest (TDF), respectively. The results showed that both mean SLA and height decreased from TMEF to TDF, while phenotypic plasticity for the two functional traits increased from TMEF to TDF. Correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis showed that the mean SLA and its plasticity were significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus. The mean height was only significantly correlated with air temperature, but its plasticity was significantly correlated with both air temperature and soil phosphorus. Our results suggest that plants in dwarf tropical cloud forests have decreased SLA and height, correlated with less favorable soil and atmospheric conditions, with a higher plasticity of these traits, as compared with the tropical montane evergreen forest. Community-level differences in SLA and plant height thus can be taken as indicators characterizing plant distribution to different types of tropical cloud forests.",,2011,"Long, Wenxing; Zang, Runguo & Ding, Yi",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0367253011001095,,SLA and Cloud

Compared to existing studies on virtual machine scaling, this paper introduces Hurst exponent which gives additional characteristics for data trends to supplement the often used Markov transition approach. This approach captures both the long and short-term behaviors of the virtual machines (VMs). The dataset for testing of this approach was gathered from the computer usage of key servers supporting a large university.

,QoS-aware SLA-based Advanced Reservation of Infrastructure as a Service,"Cloud computing effectively implements the vision of utility computing by employing a pay-as-you-go cost model and allowing on-demand (re-)leasing of IT resources. Small or medium-sized Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers, however, find it challenging to satisfy all requests immediately due to their limited resource capacity. In that situation, both providers and customers may benefit greatly from advanced reservation of virtual resources, i.e. virtual machines. In our work, we assume SLA-based resource requests and introduce an advanced reservation methodology during SLA negotiation by using computational geometry. Thereby, we are able to verify, record and manage the infrastructure resources efficiently. Based on that model, service providers can easily verify the available capacity for satisfying the customer's Quality-of-Service requirements. Furthermore, we introduce flexible alternative counter-offers, when the service provider lacks resources. Therefore, our mechanism increases the utilization of the resources and attempts to satisfy as many customers as possible.",,2011,"Lu, Kuan; Roblitz, Thomas; Yahyapour, Ramin; Yaqub, Edwin & Kotsokalis, Constantinos",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6133155 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2114498.2116221,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Cloud computing era calls for a more open content service mode. In order to construct open service relationship, we propose one novel CDN-P2P loosely-coupled SLA negotiation model. CDN firstly needs to provide an open and standard-based agreement interface for the P2P and other applications to negotiate with it. Therefore, we use Web Services Agreement Specification (WS-Agreement) for establishing agreement between two CDN and P2P. This scheme also allows CDN easily integrated with other application. The loosely-coupled CDN-P2P-SLA establishment needs to link with SLA performance monitoring, we design WSDM based CDN-P2P loosely coupled SLA monitoring scheme.

,Hybrid shuffled frog leaping algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic consolidation of virtual machines in cloud data centers,"Cloud computing aims to provide dynamic leasing of server capabilities as scalable virtualized services to end users. However, data centers hosting cloud applications consume vast amounts of electrical energy, thereby contributing to high operational costs and carbon footprints. Green cloud computing solutions that can not only minimize the operational costs but also reduce the environmental impact are necessary. This study focuses on the Infrastructure as a Service model, where custom virtual machines (VMs) are launched in appropriate servers available in a data center. A complete data center resource management scheme is presented in this paper. The scheme can not only ensure user quality of service (through service level agreements) but can also achieve maximum energy saving and green computing goals. Considering that the data center host is usually tens of thousands in size and that using an exact algorithm to solve the resource allocation problem is difficult, the modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm and improved extremal optimization are employed in this study to solve the dynamic allocation problem of VMs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed resource management scheme exhibits excellent performance in green cloud computing.",,2014,"Luo, Jian-ping; Li, Xia & Chen, Min-rong",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417414001778,,SLA and Cloud
,Enhanced geolocation of spaceborne laser altimeter surface returns: parameter calibration from the simultaneous reduction of altimeter range and navigation tracking data,"The accurate geolocation of a laser altimeter’s surface return, the spot from which the laser energy reflects on the Earth’s surface, is a critical issue in the scientific application of these data. Pointing, ranging, timing and orbit errors must be compensated to accurately geolocate these data. Detailed laser altimeter measurement models have been developed and implemented within precision orbit determination software providing the capability to simultaneously estimate the orbit and geolocation parameters from a combined reduction of altimeter range and spacecraft tracking data. In preparation for NASA’s future dedicated Earth observing spaceborne laser altimeter missions, the Vegetation Canopy Lidar (VCL) and the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), data from two Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA) missions have been reprocessed to test and refine these algorithms and to develop the analysis methodologies for the production and verification of enhanced geolocation products. Both direct altimetry and dynamic crossover data have been reduced in combination with navigation tracking data to obtain significant improvement in SLA geolocation accuracy. Residual and overlap precision tests indicate a factor of two improvement over the previously released SLA Standard Data Products, showing 40-m RMS horizontal and 26-cm RMS elevation geolocation precision for the long SLA-01 arcs. Accuracy estimates by comparing SLA profiles to Digital Elevation Models show horizontal positioning accuracy at the 60-m (1$\sigma$) level. Vertical accuracies, on the order of 1 m (1$\sigma$) for low slope surfaces are now dominated by the ±75-cm one-way range resolution of the instrument. Comparable relative improvements are also observed in the analysis of the SLA-02 data. The analyses show that complex temporal variations in parameters (i.e., pointing) can be recovered and not just simple biases. The methodology and results obtained from the detailed analysis are discussed in this paper, along with their applicability to VCL and ICESat.",,2002,"Luthcke, S.B.; Carabajal, C.C. & Rowlands, D.D.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264370702000479,,SLA and Cloud

,SLA negotiation and enforcement policies for revenue maximization and client classification in cloud providers,"In Cloud Computing markets, owners of computing resources negotiate with their potential clients to sell computing power. The terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) to be provided as well as the economic conditions are established in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). The common objective of a Cloud provider is to maximize its economic profit. However, there are situations in which providers must differentiate the SLAs with respect to the type of client that is willing to access the resources or the agreed QoS, e.g. when the hardware resources are shared between users of the company that own the resources and external users. This article proposes two sets of policies to manage SLAs with respect to the business objectives of a Cloud provider: Revenue Maximization or classification of clients. The criterion to classify clients is established according to the relationship between client and provider (external user, internal or another privileged relationship) and the QoS that the client purchases (cheap contracts or extra QoS by paying an extra fee).

,Client Classification Policies for SLA Enforcement in Shared Cloud Datacenters,"In Utility Computing business model, the owners of the computing resources negotiate with their potential clients to sell computing power. The terms of the Quality of Service (QoS) and the economic conditions are established in a Service-Level Agreement (SLA). There are many scenarios in which the agreed QoS cannot be provided because of errors in the service provisioning or failures in the system. Since providers have usually different types of clients, according to their relationship with the provider or by the fee that they pay, it is important to minimize the impact of the SLA violations in preferential clients. This paper proposes a set of policies to provide better QoS to preferential clients in such situations. The criterion to classify clients is established according to the relationship between client and provider (external user, internal or another privileged relationship) and the QoS that the client purchases (cheap contracts or extra QoS by paying an extra fee).

,Challenges and Opportunities in Consolidation at High Resource Utilization: Non-monotonic Response Time Variations in n-Tier Applications,"A central goal of cloud computing is high resource utilization through hardware sharing; however, utilization often remains modest in practice due to the challenges in predicting consolidated application performance accurately. We present a thorough experimental study of consolidated n-tier application performance at high utilization to address this issue through reproducible measurements. Our experimental method illustrates opportunities for increasing operational efficiency by making consolidated application performance more predictable in high utilization scenarios. The main focus of this paper are non-trivial dependencies between SLA-critical response time degradation effects and software configurations (i.e., readily available tuning knobs). Methodologically, we directly measure and analyze the resource utilizations, request rates, and performance of two consolidated n-tier application benchmark systems (RUBBoS) in an enterprise-level computer virtualization environment. We find that monotonically increasing the workload of an n-tier application system may unexpectedly spike the overall response time of another co-located system by 300 percent despite stable throughput. Based on these findings, we derive a software configuration best-practice to mitigate such non-monotonic response time variations by enabling higher request-processing concurrency (e.g., more threads) in all tiers. More generally, this experimental study increases our quantitative understanding of the challenges and opportunities in the widely used (but seldom supported, quantified, or even mentioned) hypothesis that applications consolidate with linear performance in cloud environments.",,2012,"Malkowski, Simon; Kanemasa, Yasuhiko; Chen, Hanwei; Yamamoto, Masao; Wang, Qingyang; Jayasinghe, Deepal; Pu, Calton & Kawaba, Motoyuki",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253502 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.245.1413 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353854,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

The cloud market is still in its infancy and all major issues, ranging from interoperability and standardization, to legislation and SLA contracts are still wide open.

,Cloud Service Negotiation in Internet of Things Environment: A Mixed Approach,"Internet of Things (IoT) allows connected objects to communicate via the Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Also, when coupled with IoT, cloud computing can in turn deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner. As the cloud market becomes more open and competitive, Quality of Service (QoS) will be more important. However, cloud providers and cloud consumers have different, and sometimes opposite, preferences. If such a conflict occurs, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) cannot be reached without negotiation. A tradeoff negotiation approach can outperform a concession approach in terms of utility, but may incur more failures if information is incomplete. To balance utility and success rate, we propose a mixed approach for cloud service negotiation, which is based on the “game of chicken.” In particular, if one is uncertain about the strategy of its counterpart, it is best to mix concession and tradeoff strategies in negotiation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive simulations. Results show that a mixed negotiation approach can achieve a higher utility than a concession approach, while incurring fewer failures than a tradeoff approach.",,2014,"Martin, Patrick & Brohman, Kathryn",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6746014,,SLA and Cloud

,Load balancing in cloud-based content delivery networks using adaptive server activation/deactivation,"Content delivery networks have been widely used for many years providing service for millions of users. Lately, many of these networks are migrating to the cloud for its numerous advantages such as lower costs, increased performance, availability and flexibility in installing new resources. This paper introduces a new approach towards load balancing as well as power reduction in cloud-based content delivery networks allowing for a controlled scaling of operational parameters within the tradeoff between power consumption and quality of experience (QoE). By applying a new proposed adaptive server activation/ deactivation model at each data center in the cloud, unutilized servers at the data center can be switched off to reduce the power consumption. This adaptive model also allows the data center to maintain its performance while being utilized up to 95\%. Performance measures of data centers are crucial as there are certain user service level agreements (SLA) for the cloud subscribers that should not be violated; most important is the latency for users' requests. The proposed load balancing algorithm benefits from limited latency for requests by only shifting the load off a data center when it is almost fully loaded. When the load in a data center exceeds a critical level, processes are migrated to underloaded data centers within the cloud. The self-controlled adaptive resource management supports easing of the cloud management.",,2012,"Mashaly, Maggie; Kuhn, Paul J. & K\""{u}hn, Paul J.",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2414276.2414302 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6396140,International Teletraffic Congress,SLA and Cloud

We then focus on one of these levels by analyzing monitored data from virtual machines and making decisions on their resource configuration with the help of knowledge management (KM). The monitored data stems both from synthetically generated workload categorized in different workload volatility classes and from a real-world scenario: scientific workflow applications in bioinformatics. As KM techniques, we investigate two methods, Case-Based Reasoning and a rule-based approach. We design and implement both of them and evaluate them with the help of a simulation engine. Simulation reveals the feasibility of the CBR approach and major improvements by the rule-based approach considering SLA violations, resource utilization, the number of necessary reconfigurations and time performance for both, synthetically generated and real-world data.",,2013,"Maurer, Michael; Brandic, Ivona & Sakellariou, Rizos",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2405839.2405924 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X12001525,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

,Self-Adaptive and Resource-Efficient SLA Enactment for Cloud Computing Infrastructures,"Cloud providers aim at guaranteeing Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in a resource-efficient way. This, amongst others, means that resources of virtual (VMs) and physical machines (PMs) have to be autonomically allocated responding to external influences as workload or environmental changes. Thereby, workload volatility (WV) is one of the crucial factors that influence the quality of suggested allocations. In this paper we devise a novel approach for self-adaptive and resource-efficient decision-making considering the three conflicting goals of minimizing the number of SLA violations, maximizing resource utilization, and minimizing the number of necessary time- and energy-consuming reconfiguration actions. We propose self-adaptive rule-based knowledge management for autonomic VM reconfiguration considering the rapidness of changes in the workload, i.e., WV. We introduce a novel WV categorization and present cost and volatility based methods for self-tuning. We evaluate these methods by a large variety of synthetically generated workloads, and by real-world measurements gathered from an image rendering application and a scientific workflow for RNA sequencing. Evaluation shows that in most cases the self-adaptive approach outperforms the static approach.",,2012,"Maurer, Michael; Brandic, Ivona; Sakellariou, Rizos & Br, Ivona",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253527 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.370.1171 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353837,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Revealing the MAPE loop for the autonomic management of Cloud infrastructures,"Cloud computing is the result of the convergence of several concepts, ranging from virtualization, distributed application design, Grid computing, and enterprise IT management. Efficient management of Cloud computing infrastructures faces with the contradicting goals like unlimited scalability, provision of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), extensive use of virtualization, energy efficiency and minimization of the administration overhead by humans. Thus, autonomic computing seems to be one of the promising paradigms for the implementation of the management infrastructures for Clouds. However, currently available autonomic systems do not consider the characteristics of Clouds, e.g., virtualization layer, and thus are not easily applicable to Cloud infrastructures. In this paper we discuss first steps towards revealing the current MAPE (Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Execution) loops for the application to Cloud infrastructures. We present novel techniques for the adequate monitoring of Clouds, discuss the approach for the knowledge management and present our solutions for facilitating SLA generation and management.",,2011,"Maurer, Michael; Breskovic, Ivan; Emeakaroha, Vincent C. & Brandic, Ivona",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2193324.2194232 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5984008,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Cost–benefit analysis of an SLA mapping approach for defining standardized Cloud computing goods,"Due to the large variety in computing resources and, consequently, the large number of different types of service level agreements (SLAs), computing resource markets face the problem of a low market liquidity. Restricting the number of different resource types to a small set of standardized computing resources seems to be the appropriate solution to counteract this problem. Standardized computing resources are defined through an SLA template. An SLA template defines the structure of an SLA, the service attributes, the names of the service attributes, and the service attribute values. However, since existing research results have only introduced static SLA templates so far, the SLA templates cannot reflect changes in user needs and market structures. To address this shortcoming, we present a novel approach of adaptive SLA matching. This approach adapts SLA templates based on SLA mappings of users. It allows Cloud users to define mappings between a public SLA template, which is available in the Cloud market, and their private SLA templates, which are used for various in-house business processes of the Cloud user. Besides showing how public SLA templates are adapted to the demand of Cloud users, we also analyze the costs and benefits of this approach. Costs are incurred every time a user has to define a new SLA mapping to a public SLA template due to its adaptation. In particular, we investigate how the costs differ with respect to the public SLA template adaptation method. The simulation results show that the use of heuristics within adaptation methods allows balancing the costs and benefits of the SLA mapping approach.",,2012,"Maurer, Michael; Emeakaroha, Vincent C.; Brandic, Ivona & Altmann, J\""{o}rn",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2304777.2304870 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X11001051,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

,Handling Performance Sensitive Native Cloud Applications with Distributed Cloud Computing and SLA Management,"Cloud computing has been used as a platform to reduce cost and increase deployment flexibility for traditional enterprise three-tier web, and some video streaming applications. Typically these types of applications have fairly simple and self-understood performance requirements. Fine-grained constraints on the computation, storage, and networking resources are required support mission-critical enterprise use-cases at a reasonable cost. They are spelled out by service level agreements (SLAs) between the application and the cloud platform. Moreover, new distributed cloud platforms allow for additional deployment patterns, supporting more performance sensitive applications. For example, a specific gaming component will benefit being deployed in the proximity of the (mobile) end-user due to low-latency requirements. In this paper, we motivate the need for more complex performance requirement support with two use cases, electric utility metering and control and public safety. We describe an application management tool, called the Abstract Service Manager (ASM), which is designed to allow the expression of performance requirements in the automated deployment of distributed cloud-native applications. Together with a distributed cloud orchestration system, the ASM automatically mitigates the complexity of constructing performance sensitive applications and their deployment on a distributed cloud.",,2013,"Mazmanov, Dimitri; Curescu, Calin; Olsson, Hjalmar; Ton, Andrew & Kempf, James",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2588611.2588656 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6809451,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A SLA-compliant Cloud resource allocation framework for N-tier applications,"IaaS is commonly offered by Cloud vendors where VMs can be created and run on cloud resources. The resource allocation for each VM is defined by the user and the VM is created on a physical machine where ample resources exist to support the VMs operation at the maximum expected load. There are a number of opportunities for improvement when allocating host resources to VMs. VM-resident applications are often n-tier, with different VMs responsible for parts of the distributed application. The network proximity to the user may be an issue for some applications. Resource allocation to VMs should also be such that, rather than a user over-provisioning the VM, the VMs minimal operational requirements are specified so that the VM can be resource-throttled at times of heavy load. This paper presents a system called Innkeeper, a three-tiered distributed approach which aims to dynamically allocate resources to VMs in a way that ensures SLA compliance, with consideration given to the network conditions between related VMs. Initial experiments show that the InnKeeper framework provides a means of real-time, SLA-compliant allocation of distributed cloud resources.",,2012,"McConnell, Aaron; Parr, Gerard; McClean, Sally; Morrow, Philip & Scotney, Bryan",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6483653,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Dynamic cloud service topology adaption for minimizing resources while meeting performance goals,"Even in the cloud computing era, meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) of a computing service or application while significantly reducing the total cost of ownership (TCO) remains a challenge. Cloud and software defined environments (SDEs) are offering new opportunities for how resources can be utilized to an even higher degree than before—which leads to a reduced TCO for service providers and customers of a service. The traditional method of meeting an SLA is to assess peak workloads and size a system accordingly. This still leads to very low average compute resource utilization rates. This paper presents a novel dynamic and cost-efficient orchestration approach of multi-tenant capable, software defined system topologies based on a monitor-analyze-plan-execute (MAPE) concept.

As most of the time a data center remains underutilized, a significant amount of energy can be conserved by migrating virtual machines (VM) running on underutilized machines to other machines and hibernating such underutilized machines. This paper aims to design such a strategy for energy-efficient cloud data centers. It makes use of historical traffic data from data centers and uses a service request prediction model which enables the identification of the number of active servers required at a given moment, thus making possible the hibernation of underutilized servers.

In all these cases, a semantic negotiation is required to reciprocally making understandable the messages exchanged about the cloud service characteristics. In this work we propose a protocol for supporting the SLA negotiation process, involving semantic issues, which do not require the use of a common global agent ontology sharing knowledge in advance.

,Provisioning data analytic workloads in a cloud,"Data analytics applications are well-suited for a cloud environment. In this paper we examine the problem of provisioning resources in a public cloud to execute data analytic workloads. The goal of our provisioning method is to determine the most cost-effective configuration for a given data analytic workload. Provisioning a workload in a public cloud environment faces several challenges: it is difficult to develop accurate performance prediction models using standard methods; the space of possible configurations is very large so exact solutions cannot be efficiently determined, and the mix and intensity of query classes in a workload vary dynamically over time. We provide a formulation of the provisioning problem and then define a framework to solve the problem. Our framework contains a cost model to predict the cost of executing a workload on a configuration and a method of selecting configurations. The cost model balances resource costs and penalties from SLAs. The specific resource demands and frequencies are accounted for by queueing network models of the Virtual Machines (VMs), which are used to predict performance.

,An SLA Ontology to Support Service Discovery in Future Cloud Markets,"Today a few providers dominate the market of cloud services. Very often, services advertised by different commercial providers are comparable in terms of offered features (both functional and non-functional) and price. We believe the lack of interoperability among cloud platforms is the main cause for this panorama of flattened cloud offers. Luckily, many initiatives are working at the definition of specifications that, once successfully adopted, will open up a new scenario of interoperable clouds. In that scenario, cloud providers will have to diversify their offerings in order to serve the widest possible range of customers' request, customers, in their turn, will be able to choose, from a large assortment of services, those fitting their specific needs. In this work we address these issues by proposing a semantic discovery framework to support providers in creating and advertising their augmented offers, and to help customers making fine-tuned cloud service searches. Final objective is to implement an offer-demand matchmaking process capable of maximizing providers' and customers' utility. To enable mechanisms capable of reasoning on the actual requests' needs and offers' features, ontologies have been defined that describe the cloud context from a business point of view. In particular, guarantees offered by SLAs are the key business features put under the focus of this work.

,Power aware provisioning in cloud computing environment,"In today's IT computing era, there is shift to aggregate computing resources into data centers (DC) shared by pool of users. With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, this pool of users are now more global than any-time in the past The resource demand of these users are inadvertently governed by strict “service level agreements”. In this paradigm, data centers' operational energy costs are a rising concern as they continue an upward trend that is poised to surpass the capital cost of equipment in a typical lifetime usage model. A data center is a complex distributed system comprised of a hierarchy of numerous components; and operating at multitude levels of usage abstractions. Virtualization is an approach to consolidating multiple services onto a smaller number of computing resources. A virtualized server environment allows computing resources to be shared among multiple performance-isolated platforms called virtual machines. Virtual Machine(VM) technology has been widely applied in data center environments due to its seminal features, including reliability, flexibility, and the ease of management. We define set of service-provider controllable policies comprising of number of physical servers, possible number of VMs, possible VM request queue length and maximum number of requests per VM threshold. For each of these defined policy, we implement a dynamic resource provisioning framework for virtualized server environment which achieves power efficiency by using optimum power efficient allocation and workload forecasting scheme to ensure that workload request meet the defined SLAs and the data center operates with least power consumption.

,Customer-aware resource overallocation to improve energy efficiency in realtime Cloud Computing data centers,"Energy efficiency is becoming a very important concern for Cloud Computing environments. These are normally composed of large and power consuming data centers to provide the required elasticity and scalability to their customers. In this context, many efforts have been developed to balance the loads at host level. However, determining how to maximize the resources utilization at Virtual Machine (VM) level still remains as a big challenge. This is mainly driven by very dynamic workload behaviors and a wide variety of customers' resource utilization patterns. This paper introduces a dynamic resource provisioning mechanism to overallocate the capacity of real-time Cloud data centers based on customer utilization patterns. Furthermore, its impact on the trade-off between energy efficiency and SLA fulfillment is analyzed. The main idea is to exploit the resource utilization patterns of each customer to decrease the waste produced by resource request overestimations. This creates the opportunity to allocate additional VMs in the same host incrementing its energy efficiency. Nevertheless, this also increases the risk of QoS affectations. The proposed model considers SLA deadlines, predictions based on historical data, and dynamic occupation to determine the amount of resources to overallocate for each host.

,Decreasing Impact of SLA Violations:A Proactive Resource Allocation Approachfor Cloud Computing Environments,"User satisfaction as a significant antecedent to user loyalty has been highlighted by many researchers in market based literatures. SLA violation as an important factor can decrease users' satisfaction level. The amount of this decrease depends on user's characteristics. Some of these characteristics are related to QoS requirements and announced to service provider through SLAs. But some of them are unknown for service provider and selfish users are not interested to reveal them truly. Most the works in literature ignore considering such characteristics and treat users just based on SLA parameters. So, two users with different characteristics but similar SLAs have equal importance for the service provider. In this paper, we use two user's hidden characteristics, named willingness to pay for service and willingness to pay for certainty, to present a new proactive resource allocation approach with aim of decreasing impact of SLA violations. New methods based on learning automaton for estimation of these characteristics are provided as well. To validate our approach we conducted some numerical simulations in critical situations. The results confirm that our approach has ability to improve users' satisfaction level that cause to gain in profitability.",,2014,"Morshedlou, Hossein & Meybodi, Mohammad Reza",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6734676,,SLA and Cloud

,Cloud Sourcing – Next Generation Outsourcing?,"Although Cloud Sourcing has been around for some time it could be questioned what actually is known about it. This paper presents a literature review on the specific question if Cloud Sourcing could be seen as the next generation of outsourcing. The reason for doing this is that from an initial sourcing study we found that the sourcing decisions seems to go in the direction of outsourcing as a service which could be described as Cloud Sourcing. Whereas some are convinced that Cloud Sourcing reduces cost and complexity in advantage for increased labor productivity, others maintain that the negotiation with the cloud provider is crucial to ensure data privacy, security regulations, compliance, standards, tolerance for risk, governance and service level agreements. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the debate on Cloud Sourcing in the top IS conferences and AIS basket of 8 journals goes in the direction of Cloud Sourcing being the future of sourcing as practice predicts, and to identify the space for the development of this research.

,Dynamic SLA based elastic cloud service management: A SaaS perspective,"Elasticity is one of the most attractive features of cloud computing. While elastic resource requirements of a cloud service user often exhibit periodic patterns, the absence of a mechanism to specify precisely the elastic resource requirements forces the cloud service provider to either provision unbounded resources or offer services with rigid and static resources, none of which is an efficient or economic proposition to the tenant. We propose, in this paper, a novel model of dynamic service level agreement (SLA) for the tenants to specify their elastic resource requirements so that the cloud service provider can take an informed decision for resource management, thereby optimizing on resource utilization, user expenses and generated revenue. We study the problem from a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) perspective. We propose an intuitive model of dynamic SLA that can capture the anticipated license requirement variation of an SaaS user. We also propose ILP and greedy-heuristic based optimization approaches for the service provider to solve the tenant on-boarding problem with dynamic SLA constraints. Experimental results show that our solution produces optimal or near-optimal (for heuristic based approach) performance in terms of overall resource utilization and the economy for both the service provider and the tenants.",,2013,"Nandi, B.B.; Banerjee, A.; Ghosh, S.C. & Banerjee, N.",,,SLA and Cloud

Providing adequate fault tolerance guarantees to diverse applications is an important challenge. Fault tolerance needs vary from one application to another. Fault tolerance consumes resources. In this paper, we propose fault tolerance to be added as a service, termed here as FTaaS, which can provide both spatial and temporal redundancies. A tenant (who seeks fault tolerance services) can express its intended fault tolerance level as part of the Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we investigate a general setting, where a tenant can execute in different modes, with different fault tolerance criterion. The task of a provider (who sells fault tolerance services) is to configure his offerings in accordance to the tenants' requirements, in a way which keeps his customers satisfied and his revenue is maximized. We consider several variations of this problem in the paper. We also discuss the other side of the tenant-provider setting, wherein a tenant has multiple providers to choose from, keeping in mind the requirements he has and the cost he has to pay to avail the services.

The Cloud-based DDoS attacks or outside DDoS attacks can make ostensibly legitimate requests for a service to generate an economic Distributed Denial of Service (eDDoS) - where the elastic nature of the cloud allows scaling of service beyond the economic means of the purveyor to pay their cloud-based service bills which leads to Economic Denial of Sustainability (EDoS). Attacks mimicking legitimate users are on the climb. For cloud computing to remain attractive, the DDoS threat is to be addressed before it triggers the billing mechanism.

The use of server virtualization techniques for such platforms provide great flexibility with the ability to consolidate several virtual machines on the same physical server, to resize a virtual machine capacity and to migrate virtual machine across physical servers. A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs.

The QoS management in distributed storage systems is a challenging task given the possible storage device heterogeneity, the dynami- cally changing data access patterns, the client's concurrency and storage resource sharing. The problem becomes even more complicated when distributed computing environments with virtualized and shared resources like Clouds are considered.

A change deployment schedule for making changes to PaaS instances often depends on the cloud provider policies and on the SLAs between the clients and the cloud provider. Different sets of cloud provider policies may result in different deployment schedules. Changes are not always successful. This may result in a change being unsuccessful and a return to a previous state in order to re-start the change. Neither is desirable since it may be impact SLA guarantees such as service availability or service time that could result in the cloud provider paying out penalties. Since changes are not all applied at once it may be desirable to modify the change deployment schedule. For example, if an operator is not highly skilled or if the change's complexity is higher than expected then it may be preferable to apply the change during a time period when there are relatively few customers in order to minimize SLA violations. This paper shows how strategy trees can be incorporated into an autonomic change management system that could result in a switch of cloud provider policy sets to determine a new deployment schedule on the fly. Our experiments show that this approach can save time while minimizing SLA violations.",,2011,"Otsuka, Hiroshi & Lutfiyya, Hanan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2147671.2147693,International Federation for Information Processing,SLA and Cloud

,Towards a ramework for automated service negotiation in cloud computing,"The on-demand service provision model in cloud computing necessitates the use of well-established service level agreements (SLA). A SLA is a part of a service contract between the consumer and provider that formally defines the level of service. In cloud computing, SLAs are necessary to control the use of computing resources. Therefore, a main issue for cloud computing is to build a new layer to support a negotiation phase between service providers and consumers to establish SLAs between them. In this paper, we propose a software agent based automated service negotiation framework for on-demand cloud service provision. In this framework, autonomous agents act on half of service providers and consumers to participate in negotiations in automated and efficient way. We also propose a bilateral multi-step monotonic concession negotiation protocol for service negotiation in cloud computing environments.",,2011,"Pan, Li",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6045091,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,The use of CT scan and stereo lithography apparatus technologies in a canine individualized rib prosthesis.,"OBJECTIVE: To design and fabricate canine rib prosthesis with full geometric shape using computed tomography (CT) scan combined with computer-aided design (CAD) and stereo lithographic (SLA) technologies and to evaluate the accuracy of this method. METHODS: After scanned on 64 rows helical CT, the cortex part of the right 7th rib was selected as the prototype for design and manufacture of the rib prosthesis and image data were stored as DICOM format. Three-dimensional (3D) surface reconstruction was applied to produce 3D image of the 7th rib and results were outputted as STL format which were then modified by UG software for establishment of CAD model. RESULTS: The rib prosthesis with full geometric shape was obtained based on CT scanning and SLA technique. About 30,000 point cloud data were acquired after 3D laser scan of the ribs. When comparing the rib prosthesis with the rib prototype, the maximum positive deviation, maximum negative deviation, average deviation and standard deviation were 1.764 mm, -2.126 mm, 0.183/-0.253 mm and 0.346 mm, respectively. There were about 88.17\% of the point cloud data within the range of ±0.5 mm. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to design and fabricate rib prosthesis with full geometric shape by using CT scanning technology combined with CAD and SLA technologies. This method is fast, convenient and precise for manufacturing prosthesis.

So clearly the answer is, that it does not owes its origin from a single technology there are lots of technologies that are working behind this. The technologies working behind the cloud computing are cluster computing, grid computing, peer-to-peer (P2P) computing, SOA, autonomic computing, map reduce etc. Also cloud computing has some features of utility computing and virtualization. From all above said technologies virtualization forms the core of cloud computing. So in this paper we are going to talk about virtualization i.e. what actually virtualization is, what are its various features because of which it acts as the main technology for cloud computing, what are its various types, how virtualization can be achieved etc. As the main aim of the virtualization is to utilize more and more hardware resources i.e. cpu, memory, storage etc, so under given load conditions whenever we change the configuration of virtual machines there will definitely some effect on the performance of cloud virtual machine, that is why in this paper we are also going to give the brief introduction to various parameters that will be affected by the amount of load on virtual machine using which we can measure or monitor the performance of virtual machines.",,2014,"Pandey, Asmita",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6799630,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,THEMIS: A Mutually Verifiable Billing System for the Cloud Computing Environment,"With the widespread adoption of cloud computing, the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a credible and verifiable way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike. The success of such a billing system depends on several factors: The billing transactions must have integrity and nonrepudiation capabilities; the billing transactions must be nonobstructive and have a minimal computation cost; and the service level agreement (SLA) monitoring should be provided in a trusted manner. Existing billing systems are limited in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and nonobstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. The cloud notary authority generates mutually verifiable binding information that can be used to resolve future disputes between a user and a cloud service provider in a computationally efficient way. Furthermore, to provide a forgery-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. The performance evaluation confirms that the overall latency of THEMIS billing transactions (avg. 4.89 ms) is much shorter than the latency of public key infrastructure (PKI)-based billing transactions (avg. 82.51 ms), though THEMIS guarantees identical security features as a PKI.

,VM Provisioning Method to Improve the Profit and SLA Violation of Cloud Service Providers,"Cloud computing is an emerging technology in the IT world. Some features of cloud, such as low cost, scalability, robustness and availability are attracting large-scale industries as well as small businesses towards cloud. A virtual machine (VM) is a software that can run its own operating system and applications just like an operating system on a physical computer. As the number of users increases, allocation of resources and scheduling become a complex task in a cloud. In a federated cloud environment when resource requirements of user requests exceed resource limits of cloud provider, to fulfil the requests the cloud provider can out-source to other cloud providers' resources. Under these circumstances it is desirable to minimize the Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations. This can be achieved through load balancing. This paper proposes a load balancing algorithm that is threshold based. We consider two types of pricing models for VMs, on-demand and reserved.

Mapping of these two group id is done by application provisioner. Fixed cost is charged on requesting reserved resource as per Service Level Agreement (SLA) and variable cost for requesting instantaneous resources. Ultimate cost charged to the user is minimized by 16\%.

,Service Level Agreement-Based Joint Application Environment Assignment and Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Systems,"Cloud computing have attracted a lot of attention recently due to increasing demand for high performance computing and storage. Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the cloud computing system especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. Moreover, a data center typically hosts and manages a suite of application environments and a fixed number of servers that are allocated to these application environments in a way that maximizes a certain utility function. In this paper, we consider the problem of SLA-based joint optimization of application environment assignment, request dispatching from the clients to the servers, as well as resource allocation in a data center comprised of heterogeneous servers. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is the total price gained from serving the clients subtracted by the operation cost of the data center. The total price depends on the average service request response time for each client as defined in their utility functions, while the operating cost is related to the total energy consumption. We propose a near-optimal solution of the joint optimization problem based on the Hungarian algorithm for the assignment problem, as well as convex optimization techniques, in a way that is similar to the constructive partitioning algorithm in VLSI computer-aided design (CAD). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed nearoptimal joint application environment assignment and resource allocation algorithm outperforms baseline algorithms by up to 65.7\%.",,2013,"Pedram, Massoud",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2495254.2495605 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6520046,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,The standardisation of cloud computing: Trends in the state-of-the-art and management issues for the next generation of cloud,"Roll-out of future cloud systems will be influenced by regulations from the standardisation bodies, if made available across the community. Trends in cloud deployment, operation and management to date have not been guided by any regulatory standards, and resources have been deployed in an ad hoc manner as demanded according to the business objectives of service providers. This is the least costly and most quickly revenue-returning business model. It is not however, the most cost-effective approach on a long-term basis: As a consequence of this roll-out model to date, the interoperability of resources deployed across clouds managed by different operators is restricted through inability to allocate workload to them in a regulated and controllable manner. The absence of standardised approaches to cloud management is therefore beginning to be accommodated such that the cost and performance advantages of interoperable operation may be exploited. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art in standards across the field and trends in their development. We present a model which defines the drivers for cloud interoperability and constraints which restrict the extent to which this may realistically occur in future scalable solutions.

,Dynamic Trust Establishment and Amended Window Based Monitoring in Cloud,"Cloud computing is becoming one of the next industry buzz words. In the current cloud computing scenario, the need for establishing an SLA is highly essential, since it expresses the commitment of provider to create an affordable balance between hosting costs and high levels of service availability during the service offerings. It is also highly necessary to monitor dynamically whether the QoS mentioned in the SLA, is met by the service provider. Moreover, a reliable trust model is required to give a quantitative measure of the trust to the requester before choosing a service provider. In this paper, we portray a dynamic trust establishment framework, wherein the Third-party SLA monitor provides an on-demand QoS assessment module, on a real time basis. Based on the computed trust value, the service provider is chosen.

,DARGOS: A highly adaptable and scalable monitoring architecture for multi-tenant Clouds,"One of the most important features in Cloud environments is to know the status and the availability of the physical resources and services present in the current infrastructure. A full knowledge and control of the current status of those resources enables Cloud administrators to design better Cloud provisioning strategies and to avoid SLA violations. However, it is not easy to manage such information in a reliable and scalable way, especially when we consider Cloud environments used and shared by several tenants and when we need to harmonize their different monitoring needs at different Cloud software stack layers. To cope with these issues, we propose Distributed Architecture for Resource manaGement and mOnitoring in cloudS (DARGOS), a completely distributed and highly efficient Cloud monitoring architecture to disseminate resource monitoring information. DARGOS ensures an accurate measurement of physical and virtual resources in the Cloud keeping at the same time a low overhead. In addition, DARGOS is flexible and adaptable and allows defining and monitoring new metrics easily. The proposed monitoring architecture and related tools have been integrated into a real Cloud deployment based on the OpenStack platform: they are openly available for the research community and include a Web-based customizable Cloud monitoring console. We report experimental results to assess our architecture and quantitatively compare it with a selection of other Cloud monitoring systems similar to ours showing that DARGOS introduces a very limited and scalable monitoring overhead.",,2013,"Povedano-Molina, Javier; Lopez-Vega, Jose M.; Lopez-Soler, Juan M.; Corradi, Antonio & Foschini, Luca",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13000824 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2537175.2537433,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

,Optimal calculation overhead for energy efficient cloud workload prediction,"Amazon recently estimated that the cost of energy for its datacenters reached 42\% of the total cost of operation. Our previous research proposed an algorithm to predict how much cloud workload is expected during a future time interval. Accurate knowledge of the future workload allows the datacenter operator to place unneeded physical servers in a low-power state to save energy. If more system capacity is required, servers in a low-power state are transitioned back to an active state. In this paper, we extend our prior research by presenting a new approach to determining the frequency of calculating the prediction of the expected capacity. We present a dynamic prediction quantization method to determine the optimal number of prediction calculation intervals. These new algorithms allow us to predict future load within required Service Level Agreements while minimizing the number of times the prediction calculations must be performed. We finally test this model by simulating the stochastic time horizon and dynamic quantization algorithms and compare the results with three competing methods. We show that our model provides up to a 20\% reduction in the number of calculations required while maintaining the given Service Level Agreement.",,2014,"Prevost, John J.; Nagothu, Kranthimanoj; Jamshidi, Mo & Kelley, Brian",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6936129,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Optimal update frequency model for physical machine state change and virtual machine placement in the cloud,"Cloud computing is evolving into the default operational framework running modern data centers. Efficient data center operation is concerned with the total amount of energy consumed as well as assuring adequate resources are available to process all of the incoming work requests. Existing research has demonstrated several algorithms that can be used to determine the optimal number of resources required to service these requests. However, a key issue not addressed in these algorithms is determining the frequency of recalculating the number of required resources. Changing the required resources at a rate slower than the optimal update frequency results in lower energy efficiency due to the over allocation of resources. Changing the resources at a rate higher than the optimal frequency results in insufficient time for systems to change state, which results in SLA violations. In this paper, a stochastic optimization model is presented that determines the optimal update frequency for changing the states of the nodes of the cloud as well as determining the proper frequency for recalculating the maximum expected load, which improves the determination of the optimum number of resources required, therefore maximizes energy efficiency and minimizes SLA violations.",,2013,"Prevost, John J.; Nagothu, Kranthimanoj; Kelley, Brian & Jamshidi, Mo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6575260,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Federated cloud mechanism helps to resolve the difficulties present in the single cloud service model. Better Resource Provisioning to user's requirements is one of the difficult tasks in federated cloud mechanism. Cloud Brokers takes the responsibility of resource provisioning in federated cloud model. Cloud brokers make use of the concept of cloud ranking to choose the best cloud service provider among the number of cloud service providers who satisfies the user requirements. Based upon the cloud ranking cloud broker assigns the user task to the selected cloud service provider. Up to now there is no standard method for cloud ranking.

,A bio inspired Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) for hybrid cloud computing environment,"Resource scheduling is a momentous task of determining and formulating when an activity should start or end depending on the number of tasks, the availability of the resources, time and processor speed. A cloud is an aggregation of resources or services that are provided as service through network. In earlier version of cloud computing (grid computing) it was enough to find the subset of resources for the applications whereas cloud computing goes one step higher allocating resources to Virtual Machines (VM's) as well as scheduling tasks on the VM's. So resource scheduling is indispensable in cloud computing for load balancing and maximizing the utilization while minimizing the execution time and energy. Few approaches relating to energy salvation have certain disadvantages such as, time complexity and slow Convergence. Hence Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) is developed by bringing together the echo-localization and hibernation properties for scheduling resources as well as conserving energy. Promotion of energy salvation in cloud environment is achieved in a well delineated manner.

An approach that is currently spreading, to face possible problems linked to a low quality of service offered, is the adoption of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper we propose the adoption of a simulation-based approach for supporting a framework in charge of SLA management in cloud applications. The idea stems from the consideration that to face the inevitable impact on QoS of the cloud elasticity, it is necessary to evaluate in a predictive way the performance properties of the many different configurations among which the automatic cloud management can choose to allocate resources to customers.

Among the incredible number of challenges in this field two of them are considered of great relevance: SLA management and Security management. The level of trust in such context is very hard to define and is strictly related to the problem of management of SLA in cloud applications and providers. In this paper we will try to show how it is possible, using a cloud-oriented API derived from the mOSAIC project, to build up an SLA-oriented cloud application which enables the management of security features related to user authentication and authorization to an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud Provider. As Cloud Provider we will adopt the perf-Cloud solution, which uses GRID-based solutions for security management and service delivery.

,Security as a Service Using an SLA-Based Approach via SPECS,"The cloud offers attractive options to migrate corporate applications, without any implication for the corporate security manager to manage or to secure physical resources. While this ease of migration is appealing, several security issues arise: can the validity of corporate legal compliance regulations still be ensured for remote data storage? How is it possible to assess the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) ability to meet corporate security requirements? Can one monitor and enforce the agreed cloud security levels? Unfortunately, no comprehensive solutions exist for these issues. In this context, we introduce a new approach, named SPECS. It aims to offer mechanisms to specify cloud security requirements and to assess the security features offered by CSPs, and to integrate the desired security services (e.g., credential and access management) into cloud services with a Security-as-a-Service approach. Furthermore, SPECS intends to provide systematic approaches to negotiate, to monitor and to enforce the security parameters specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA), to develop and to deploy security services that are cloud SLA-aware and are implemented as an open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

,Distributed resource exchange: Virtualized resource management for SR-IOV InfiniBand clusters,"The commoditization of high performance interconnects, like 40+ Gbps InfiniBand, and the emergence of low-overhead I/O virtualization solutions based on SR-IOV, is enabling the proliferation of such fabrics in virtualized datacenters and cloud computing platforms. As a result, such platforms are better equipped to execute workloads with diverse I/O requirements, ranging from throughput-intensive applications, such as `big data' analytics, to latency-sensitive applications, such as online applications with strict response-time guarantees. Improvements are also seen for the virtualization infrastructures used in data center settings, where high virtualized I/O performance supported by high-end fabrics enables more applications to be configured and deployed in multiple VMs - VM ensembles (VMEs) - distributed and communicating across multiple datacenter nodes. A challenge for I/O-intensive VM ensembles is the efficient management of the virtualized I/O and compute resources they share with other consolidated applications, particularly in lieu of VME-level SLA requirements like those pertaining to low or predictable end-to-end latencies for applications comprised of sets of interacting services. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a management solution able to consider such SLA requirements, by supporting diverse SLA-aware policies, such as those maintaining bounded SLA guarantees for all VMEs, or those that minimize the impact of misbehaving VMEs. The management solution, termed Distributed Resource Exchange (DRX), borrows techniques from principles of microeconomics, and uses online resource pricing methods to provide mechanisms for such distributed and coordinated resource management. DRX and its mechanisms allow policies to be deployed on such a cluster in order to provide SLA guarantees to some applications by charging all the interfering VMEs `equally' or based on the `hurt', i.e. amount of I/O performed by the VMEs. While these mechanisms are gen- ral, our implementation is specifically for SR-IOV-based fabrics like InfiniBand and the KVM hypervisor. Our experimental evaluation consists of workloads representative of data-analytics, transactional and parallel benchmarks. The results demonstrate the feasibility of DRX and its utility to maintain SLA for transactional applications. We also show that the impact to the interfering workloads is also within acceptable bounds for certain policies.",,2013,"Ranadive, Adit; Gavrilovska, Ada & Schwan, Karsten",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6702653,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

We propose to exploit capacity planning to support bilateral negotiation processes with the aim of optimizing the utility for service providers, by avoiding contracts that could incur in SLAs violations, keeping, at the same time, competitive prices. The proposed technique exploits a non-additive utility function defined in the region of acceptable SLA proposals, taking into account QoS, resources availability, costs and penalties.

,SLA-based Content Delivery in Multi-CDNs,"Broadband network technologies have improved the bandwidth of the edge of the Internet but its core is still a bottleneck for large file transfers. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), built at the edge of the Internet, are able to reduce the workload of network backbones but their scalability and network reach is often limited, especially in case of QoS-bound delivery services. By using the emerging CDN internetworking, a CDN can dynamically exploit resources of other cooperating CDNs to face peak loads and temporary malfunctions without violating QoS levels negotiated with content providers. This paper proposes an architectural schema and an algorithm to minimize transfer time of large files taking into account the SLA constraints agreed between the CDN in charge of content delivery and the content provider, while respecting the maximum budget that the CDN can pay to peer CDNs to ensure its revenue.

,SLA evaluation in cloud-based data-centric distributed services,"Given the business mode of offering computing services to customers in a cloud setting, a major question arises: how good are the services of a cloud provider when compared to that of other providers. The paper attempts to answer the question by describing a methodology to measure the various cloud parameters (such as VM cycles and number of VM instances) at run-time and map them onto meaningful service-level attributes. The paper provides a concrete definition of the service attributes experienced by the client application: such as availability, agility, and elasticity, in terms of the underlying cloud infrastructure parameters (i.e., VM instances and network bandwidth). Since the IaaS parameters are hard to measure directly, we resort to a measurement methodology that maps the client-visible PaaS-layer service attributes onto the underlying IaaS parameters exported by the cloud provider.

,Automatic SLA Matching and Provider Selection in Grid and Cloud Computing Markets,"Cloud computing is a novel computing paradigm that offers data, software, and hardware services in a manner similar to traditional utilities such as water, electricity, and telephony. Usually, in Cloud and Grid computing, contracts between traders are established using Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which include objectives of service usage. However, due to the rapidly growing number of service offerings and the lack of a standard for their specification, manual service selection is a costly task, preventing the successful implementation of ubiquitous computing on demand. In order to counteract these issues, automatic methods for matching SLAs are necessary. In this paper, we introduce a method for finding semantically equal SLA elements from differing SLAs by utilizing several machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we utilize this method to enable automatic selection of optimal service offerings for Cloud and Grid users.

In this paper we have presented the results of our experiments for estimating the self-similarity in cloud service QoS data.",,2013,"Rehman, Zia Ur; Hussain, Farookh Khadeer; Hussain, Omar Khadeer & Singh, Jaipal",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686245 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2549765.2549796,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Prediction of Job Resource Requirements for Deadline Schedulers to Manage High-Level SLAs on the Cloud,"For a non IT expert to use services in the Cloud is more natural to negotiate the QoS with the provider in terms of service-level metrics-e.g. job deadlines-instead of resource-level metrics-e.g. CPU MHz. However, current infrastructures only support resource-level metrics-e.g. CPU share and memory allocation-and there is not a well-known mechanism to translate from service-level metrics to resource-level metrics. Moreover, the lack of precise information regarding the requirements of the services leads to an inefficient resource allocation-usually, providers allocate whole resources to prevent SLA violations. According to this, we propose a novel mechanism to overcome this translation problem using an online prediction system which includes a fast analytical predictor and an adaptive machine learning based predictor. We also show how a deadline scheduler could use these predictions to help providers to make the most of their resources. Our evaluation shows: (i) that fast algorithms are able to make predictions with an 11\% and 17\% of relative error for the CPU and memory respectively; (ii) the potential of using accurate predictions in the scheduling compared to simple yet well-known schedulers.",,2010,"Reig, Gemma; Alonso, Javier; Guitart, Jordi & Cloud, On The",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5598218 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.185.2539 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1906485.1906787,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,The load balancing algorithm in cloud computing environment,"With the users and the types of application on the cloud computing platform increasing, it becomes a critical problem about how to use the resources in the system effectively to ensure service level agreements (SLA). The load balancing algorithm is an important means to achieve efficient utilization of resources. This paper presents a dynamic load balancing algorithm based on virtual machine migration under cloud computing environment. The algorithm proposed the trigger strategy based on the fractal methods. The strategy determines the timing of the virtual machine migration through forecasting the timing to determine the timing of the virtual machine migration, which can avoid the problem of the peak instantaneous load trigger. Comparing with the other algorithms, such as ant colony and honey bees, this algorithm can achieve using of resources more balance. Finally, we test the system and the experimental results show that the algorithm can achieve load balancing and improve system performance.",,2012,"Ren, Haozheng; Lan, Yihua & Yin, Chao",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6526078,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,An ontology for managing network services quality,"The evolution of IP networks to a service-oriented paradigm poses new challenges to service providers regarding the management and auditing of network services. The upward trend in ubiquity, heterogeneity and virtualization of network services and resources demands for a formal and systematic approach to network management tasks. In this context, the semantic characterization and modeling of services provided to users is a key component to sustain autonomic service management, service negotiation and configuration. The semantic and formal description of services and resources is also relevant to assist paradigms such as cloud computing, where a large diversity of resources have to be described and managed in a highly dynamic way. This paper defines an ontology for multiservice IP networks targeting multiple service management goals, namely: (i) to foster client and service provider interoperability; (ii) to manage network service contracts, promoting the dynamic negotiation between parties; (iii) to access and query SLA/SLSs data on a individual or aggregated basis to assist service provisioning in the network; and (iv) to sustain service monitoring and auditing.

,Monitoring as an SLA-oriented consumable service for SaaS assurance: A prototype,"Whether an enterprise is deploying their applications to virtual machines or 'real' machines, monitoring of those applications is often critical in meeting key business priorities. The monitoring domain is a mature and competitive one with many offerings ranging from traditional closed proprietary products to open-source collaborative projects. Whilst the offerings have continued to increase in their core monitoring capabilities and sophistication, one area which has received less attention is the programmatic control of monitoring configuration; most monitoring solutions provide little to support the solution designer's goal of loose coupling with high cohesion between the service management layer and the monitoring layer. There is still less support for such a Service Management Layer to specify it's monitoring requirements in terms of the SLA the services it manages are being offered against. The reality is that monitoring is often configured manually on an ad-hoc basis, resulting in an evolved monitoring configuration which is poorly structured, inefficient and unmanageable. This paper presents the authors' work in progressing a design which allows a service management layer to consume monitoring as a service programmatically as per the Service Oriented Architecture paradigm. This makes monitoring auditable, flexible and efficient. Further, the design shifts the primitives used to define the monitoring requirements away from machines, ports and intra-machine services (e.g. HTTP) to the SLA and the distributed services which a whole set of diverse machines co-operate in order to support (e.g. an instance of a SaaS CRM enterprise app). The aim is to allow the operator to promote the SLA such that their systems can optimise customer satisfaction while minimising their cost base. Whilst this approach offers benefits for the management of all data centres, those which are retailing a catalogue of quality-assured, cloud-based SaaS offerings may see the greatest g- - ains as the design elegantly allows for instances of the offerings to be deployed quickly and scaled automatically, including all the required SLA-driven monitoring configuration.",,2011,"Roxburgh, David; Spaven, Daniel & Gallen, Craig",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5990500,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Reducing service failures by failure and workload aware load balancing in SaaS clouds,"SLA violations are typically viewed as service failures. If service fails once, it will fail again unless remedial action is taken. In a virtualized environment, a common remedial action is to restart or reboot a virtual machine (VM). In this paper we present, a VM live-migration policy that is aware of SLA threshold violations of workload response time, physical machine (PM) and VM utilization as well as availability violations at the PM and VM. In the migration policy we take into account PM failures and VM (software) failures as well as workload features such as burstiness (coefficient of variation or CoV >1) which calls for caution during the selection of target PM when migrating these workloads. The proposed policy also considers migration of a VM when the utilization of the physical machine hosting the VM approaches its utilization threshold. We propose an algorithm that detects proactive triggers for remedial action, selects a VM (for migration) and also suggests a possible target PM. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach by plotting the decrease in the number of SLA violations in a system using our approach over existing approaches that do not trigger migration in response to non-availability related SLA violations, via discrete event simulation of a relevant case study.",,2013,"Roy, Arpan; Ganesan, Rajeshwari; Dash, Dinesh & Sarkar, Santonu",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6615511,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Keep it moving: Proactive workload management for reducing SLA violations in large scale SaaS clouds,"Software failures, workload-related failures and job overload conditions bring about SLA violations in software-as-a-service (SaaS) systems. Existing work does not address mitigation of SLA violations completely as (i) none of them address mitigation of SLA violations in business specific scenarios (SaaS, in our case), (ii) while some do not address software and workload-related failures, other approaches do not address the problem of target PM selection for workload migration comprehensively (leaving out vital considerations like workload compatibility checks between migrating VM and VMs at the target PM) and (iii) a clear mathematical mapping between workload, resource demand and SLA is lacking. In this paper, we present the Keep It Moving (KIM) software framework for the cloud controller that helps minimize service failures due to SLA violation of availability, utilization and response time in SaaS cloud data centers. Though we consider migration to be the primary mitigation technique, we also try to mitigate SLA violations without migration. We achieve this by performing a capacity check on the host physical machine (PM) before the migration to identify if enough capacity is available on the current PM to address the upcoming SLA violations by restart/reboot or VM resizing. In certain cases such as workload-related failures due to corrupt files, we prefer workload rerouting to a replica VM over migration. We formulate the selection of a target PM as a multi-objective optimization problem. We validate our proposed approach by using a trace-based discrete event simulation of a virtualized data center where failure and workload characteristics are simulated from data extracted from a real SaaS business server logs. We found that a 60\% reduction in SLA violation is possible using our approach as well as reducing VM downtime by approximately 10\%.",,2013,"Roy, Arpan; Ganesan, Rajeshwari & Sarkar, Santonu",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6698895,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,SLA-Based and Consumer-centric Dynamic Provisioning for Cloud Databases,"One of the main advantages of the cloud computing paradigm is that it simplifies the time-consuming processes of hardware provisioning, hardware purchasing and software deployment. Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. Cloud-hosted database systems powering these applications form a critical component in the software stack of these applications. Service Level Agreements (SLA) represent the contract which captures the agreed upon guarantees between a service provider and its customers. The specifications of existing service level agreement (SLA) for cloud services are not designed for flexibly handling even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. The concerns of consumers for cloud services regarding the SLA management of their hosted applications within the cloud environments will gain increasing importance as cloud computing becomes more pervasive. This paper introduces the notion, challenges and the importance of SLA-based provisioning and cost management for cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. We present an end-to-end framework that acts as a middleware which resides between the consumer applications and the cloud-hosted databases. The aim of the framework is to facilitate adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. The experimental results demonstrate that SLA-based provisioning is more adequate for providing consumer applications the required flexibility in achieving their goals.",,2012,"Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.380.8453 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253526 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353836,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Estimating service response time for elastic cloud applications,"This paper presents a Markovian analytical model to estimate service response time for elastic cloud applications. Given the expected application workload, the number of virtual machine (VM) instances, and the capacity of each VM instance, the model can approximate the mean service time. The mean service time is a critical metric to estimate, and contributes to the SLA end-to-end response time experienced by application users. The end-to-end response time is an aggregated delay of the service time in addition to delays incurred at the network nodes and links. Our analytical model focuses on estimating the mean service time; however, the model is sufficiently general and can be extremely useful in studying cloud performance. Equations for key performance measures are derived. These measures include mean response time, throughput, request loss, queueing probability, and CPU utilization. The correctness of the model has been verified using discrete-event simulation.",,2012,"Salah, Khaled & Boutaba, Raouf",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6483647,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

This paper proposes a QoS-oriented federated cloud computing framework where multiple independent cloud providers can cooperate seamlessly to provide scalable QoS-assured services and discusses a high level architecture of the federation components. The distinct features of the proposed federation framework is its QoS-orientation that can trigger the on-demand resource provisioning across multiple providers, hence helping to maximize QoS targets and resources usage, eliminate SLA violations and enhance SLA formalization.",,2014,"Salama, Maria & Shawish, Ahmed",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6899284 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2671850.2671939,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Variation of functional traits in trees from a biogeographically complex Mexican cloud forest,"Several studies have proposed a group of morpho-functional traits as determinants of the ecological strategy of species. Among these, four morpho-functional traits are considered to be relevant in determining a plant's ecological strategy: specific leaf area (SLA), height at maturity (Hmax), wood density (WD), and seed mass (SM). We examined the variation of these traits and attempted to identify functional groups among 33 tree species with different biogeographical affinities from a montane cloud forest. Covariation among the four traits was examined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and species clustering. Bivariate trait relationships were evaluated through two methods: cross-species correlations, and evolutionary divergence correlations using phylogenetically independent contrasts (PICs). Correlations between attributes were overall weak, the most obvious ones being between Hmax and SM, and between Hmax and WD; this latter trait pair was also correlated in PICs. In both analyses SLA was unrelated to all other traits. In the PCA ordination the first two axes explained 66.9\% of the between-species variation. Despite a largely continuous between-species variation, species clustering allowed differentiation of two main groups. Observed trait correlations were consistent with those reported for other floras, with the important exception of the independent behaviour of SLA. This study indicates a variety of comparable successful life history strategies among the studied species. The effect of phylogeny in trait covariation was unimportant, in fact, a mixture of clades was represented in several groups among the species they contained, suggesting among-lineage convergence.",,2008,"Salda\ {n}a-Acosta, Angela; Meave, Jorge A.; Paz, Horacio; S\'{a}nchez-Vel\'{a}squez, L\'{a}zaro R.; Villase\ {n}or, Jos\'{e} Luis & Mart\'{\i}nez-Ramos, Miguel",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1146609X08000751,,SLA and Cloud
,Seedling biomass allocation and vital rates of cloud forest tree species: Responses to light in shade house conditions,"Patterns of above- and below-ground biomass allocation in seedlings of nine common cloud forest (CF) tree species of western Mexico were examined under varying controlled light conditions using artificial shade houses. We analysed the relationships between vital rates (growth and survival) and four morphological traits (SLA, biomass allocation to stems, leaves and roots). We hypothesised that these traits represent differentiation axes in the way seedlings face the heterogeneous light regime typical of the CF understorey. For all species, traits between the different light levels, i.e. allocation to leaves, roots and stems differed among light levels. Five species had the largest SLA in the lowest light levels at the end of the experiment (Citharexylum, Dendropanax, Fraxinus, Quercus and Magnolia). Juglans was the only species with a large SLA at the highest light level (377.47cm2g−1). In contrast, light levels did not cause any significant variation in SLA of Persea and Simplococarpon at the end of the experiment. The relative height growth rates (RHGR) of the seedlings of five species were significantly different between light levels (P<0.05). Overall, all species grew better in the highest light levels. The RHGR of three species were correlated positively with SLA. In turn, allocation to stem, leaves and root biomass were strongly correlated with the RHGR of five species (e.g. Citharexylum, Dendropanax and Fraxinus). Survival did not vary significantly between treatments in any species, only in the case of Simplococarpon (P<0.05) and was correlated with all morphological variables. For this species, Peto and Peto's test showed a significantly larger survival of seedlings in the highest light level. The mean responses of these species based on all traits to the controlled light variation did not differed significantly. Our results show that these species display a wide range of resource allocation patterns when exposed to the varying light conditions that may be found in the forest understorey and highlight the role of morphological traits in this variation.",,2009,"Salda\ {n}a-Acosta, Angela; Meave, Jorge A. & S\'{a}nchez-Vel\'{a}squez, L\'{a}zaro R.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112709004988,,SLA and Cloud

SMILE allows for management of SLAs on the shared data, which means that some serious technical challenges will have to be overcome in order to guarantee the desired level of access on the shared data to all those who access it. The key challenge is in ensuring that SLA guarantees are provided in the face of multiple users with diverse workloads and SLA requirements, while providing performance guarantees for the data owners in sharing data with others using performance isolation policies.

Our work is strongly motivated by the fact that delay control plays a critical role to improve Service Level Agreements (SLA) between users and Cloud service providers, which is necessary for empowering online business. Specifically, our main contributions are two-fold: First, the feasible regions of various routing algorithms for the system's dispatcher are investigated in depth. Second, a simple heuristic algorithm is designed, to move the average delay point along the feasible direction until achieving the delay constraints. Average delay is dependent on multiple factors such as job size, inter-arrival time, flow rate, and the dispatching rules of the system. Therefore, we vary their distribution, parameters and routing rules to examine how the feasible regions move or change.

,CloudESE: Energy efficiency model for cloud computing environments,"In this paper, we propose two energy models based on a statistical analysis of a server's operational behavior in order to minimize the energy consumption in data centers at cloud computing providers. Based on these models, the Energy Savings Engine (ESE) in the cloud provider decides either to migrate the virtual machines (VMs) from a lightly-loaded server and then turn it off or put it in a sleep mode, or to keep the current server running and ready to receive any new load requests. The main difference between the two models is the energy and time required to put the server in operational mode from a sleep mode or from an off state. Therefore, the decision is a tradeoff between the energy savings and the required performance according to the SLA between the client and the cloud provider. We show results based on actual power measurements taken at the server's AC input, to determine the energy consumed in the idle state, the sleep state, the off state and in the case of switching between any two of these states.

,Efficient Deployment of Main-Memory DBMS in Virtualized Data Centers,"Running emerging main-memory database systems within virtual machines causes huge overhead, because these systems are highly optimized to get the most out of bare metal servers. But running these systems on bare metal servers results in low resource utilization, because database servers often have to be sized for peak loads, much higher than the average load. Instead, we propose to deploy them within light-weight containers that allow to control resource usage and to make use of spare resources by temporarily running other applications on the database server using virtual machines (VMs). The servers on which these VMs would normally run can be suspended, to save energy costs. But current database systems do not handle dynamic changes to resource allocation well and accurate estimates on resource demand are required to maintain SLAs. We focus on emerging main-memory database systems that support the mixed workloads of today's business intelligence applications and propose an cooperative approach in which the DBMS communicates its resource demand, gets informed about currently assigned resources and adapts its resource usage accordingly. We analyze the performance impact on the database system when spare resources are used by VMs and monitor SLA compliance.",,2012,"Seibold, Michael; Wolke, Andreas; Albutiu, Martina; Bichler, Martin; Kemper, Alfons & Setzer, Thomas",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253520 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353823,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Negotiation-Based Flexible SLA Establishment with SLA-driven Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing,"As various consumers tend to use personalized Cloud services, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) emerge as a key aspect in Cloud and Utility computing. The objectives of this doctoral research are 1) to support a flexible establishment of SLAs that enhances the utility of SLAs for both providers and consumers, and 2) to manage Cloud resources to prevent SLA violations. Because consumers and providers may be independent bodies, some mechanisms are necessary to resolve different preferences when they establish a SLA. Thus, we designed a Cloud SLA negotiation mechanism for interactive and flexible SLA establishment. The novelty of this SLA negotiation mechanism is that it can support advanced multi-issue negotiation that includes time slot and price negotiations. In addition, to prevent SLA violations, we provided a SLA-driven resource allocation scheme that selects a proper data center among globally distributed centers operated by a provider. Empirical results showed that the proposed SLA negotiation mechanism supports faster agreements and achieves higher utilities. Also, the proposed SLA-driven resource allocation scheme performs better in terms of SLA violations and the provider's profits.",,2013,Seokho Son & Sung Chan Jun,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546077,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

However, its ad hoc management of quality-of-service and SLA poses significant challenges to the performance, dependability and costs of online cloud services. The paper precisely addresses this issue and makes a threefold contribution. First, it introduces a new cloud model, the SLAaaS (SLA aware Service) model. SLAaaS enables a systematic integration of QoS levels and SLA into the cloud. It is orthogonal to other cloud models such as SaaS or PaaS, and may apply to any of them. Second, the paper introduces CSLA, a novel language to describe QoS-oriented SLA associated with cloud services. Third, the paper presents a control theoretic approach to provide performance, dependability and cost guarantees for online cloud services, with time-varying workloads. The proposed approach is validated through case studies and extensive experiments with online services hosted in clouds such as Amazon EC2. The case studies illustrate SLA guarantees for various services such as a MapReduce service, a cluster-based multi-tier e-commerce service, and a low-level locking service.",,2013,"Serrano, D.; Bouchenak, S.; Kouki, Y.; Ledoux, T.; Lejeune, J.; Sopena, J.; Arantes, L. & Sens, P.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546058,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Energy efficient architectural framework for virtual machine management in IaaS clouds,"Cloud computing is a novel computing model, involving resource outsourcing with infinite and flexible resource scalability and “plug and play” provisioning. The recent materialization of this new computing model has radically changed everyone's perception of infrastructure paradigm, development models and delivery of software. Earlier people were reluctant to go for Clouds due to doubt on performance so since its inception main emphasis has been given on performance so that SLA is not violated. So resources were over provisioned to meet peak demands which resulted in underutilization of servers in off peak hours. This resulted in high power consumption, high carbon footprints and high cooling cost. We are proposing an energy efficient framework for Virtual Machine management which will result in minimum no. of servers used which will further result in low power consumption, low carbon footprints and which will make Cloud computing economical for both consumers and providers. Our model differs from others since we have restricted CPU utilization to a threshold limit as it has been experimentally proved that power consumption increases drastically when CPU utilization increases beyond 70\%. Moreover it also gives room for scaling up resources during peak hours.",,2013,"Sharma, Viney & Srivastava, Gur Mauj Saran",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6612222,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Doing Better Business: Trading a Little Execution Time for High Energy Saving under SLA Constraints,"Large data centers are usually built to support the enormous computation and storage capability of Cloud Computing which has attracted people's attention nowadays. However, such large scale data centers generally consume an enormous amount of energy, which not only increases the running cost but also simultaneously enhances their greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing this issue, Virtualization technology is introduced, through which multiple Virtual Machines(VMs) can be centralized to fewer servers while allowing the idle servers to be dynamically powered off in order to save the energy consumption. In the paper, we investigate the impact of Virtualization technology on the energy and performance in data center environment taking into consideration various factors such as server failures and the overhead introduced by the VM contention. Noticing that there exits a tradeoff between energy consumption and execution time, we propose a stochastic model of data centers using Queueing theory to optimize performance and energy consumption. From the data center operators' prospective, they are willing to do better business by saving the energy consumption while abiding by the SLAs. Therefore, we try to find an optimal Energy-Performance tradeoff policy for the data center operators to operate data centers. The simulation results show that our model can significantly reduce the energy consumption by up to 35.4 while sacrificing a little execution time.",,2013,"Shen, Dian; Dong, Fang; Luo, Junzhou; Wang, Wei; Fei, Xiang; Jin, Guoqing & Li, Weidong",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686244 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2549765.2549795,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism in cloud computing,"With the emerging of cloud computing, more and more enterprise organizations begin to migrate their applications to IaaS, which is a more flexible and cheaper alternative to traditional infrastructures. IaaS providers usually offer customers with resources in the form of VM and charge them in a time-based billing model. Meanwhile customers are allowed to dynamically apply for VM resources. However, highly dynamic workload makes customers difficultly determine how much capacity to provision. Furthermore, it is also a great challenge for customers to determine how to choose a VM provisioning scheme to match workload at a low cost. In this paper, we propose a workload prediction-based multi-VM provisioning mechanism to overcome these challenges, which contains an ARIMA workload predictor with dynamic error compensation (ARIMA-DEC) and a time-based billing aware multi-VM provisioning algorithm (TBAMP). The experimental results show that ARIMA-DEC predictor can obviously reduce SLA default rate and TBAMP algorithm can effectively save rental cost comparing to the existing algorithms.",,2013,Shengming Li; Ying Wang; Xuesong Qiu; Deyuan Wang & Lijun Wang,,,SLA and Cloud

However, how to select appropriate cloud offerings in terms of business requirements and company policies becomes challenging and non-trivial, especially when a composition of multiple services are to be chosen for achieving business goals.

,Compliance based Trustworthiness Calculation Mechanism in Cloud Environment,"Establishing trust is one of the most challenging issues in emerging cloud computing area. It is becoming increasingly complex for cloud users to make distinction (with respect to trustworthiness) among service providers offering similar kinds of services. There must be some mechanisms in the hands of users to determine trustworthiness of service providers so that they can select service providers with confidence and with some degree of assurance that service provider will not behave unpredictably or maliciously. Though various approaches exist to form trust between service providers and users, little work has been done in the area of forming trust based on compliance of QoS parameters which have been promised in SLA. In this paper an attempt has been made to design and simulate a mechanism to calculate trustworthiness of service providers based on their compliance to promised SLA parameters. The model has been simulated in MATLAB. The validation has been done using synthetic data set. Validation results show that approach is workable and can be used to evaluate trustworthiness of service providers in a cloud environment.",,2014,"Sidhu, Jagpreet & Singh, Sarbjeet",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091401031X,,SLA and Cloud
,GeoClouds Modcs: A perfomability evaluation tool for disaster tolerant IaaS clouds,"Performance and availability are key aspects to evaluate the quality of cloud computing systems. The assessment of these systems should consider the effects of queuing and failure/recovery behavior of data center subsystems and disaster occurrences. Additionally, penalties may be applied if the defined quality level of SLA contracts is not satisfied. Thus, IaaS providers need to evaluate the performability level of its environment, considering, also, the possibility of disasters. A possible approach to protect cloud systems from natural disasters corresponds to the utilization of redundant data centers located far enough apart. However, the time to back up the VM data increases with the distance. To accomplish these issues, we propose a user-friendly tool, namely GeoClouds Modcs, for evaluating distributed cloud computing systems deployed into multiple data centers considering disaster occurrence. The proposed environment adopts a hybrid heterogeneous modeling approach, which includes Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), Stochastic Petri Nets (SPN) and Cloud System High-Level models to perform the system evaluation. For specialized users, the tool also provides specific features that enable edit and evaluate the result SPN and RBD models on external evaluation tools (i.e., Mercury and TimeNET).

,AREN: A Popularity Aware Replication Scheme for Cloud Storage,"Delivering on-demand web content to end-users in order to carry out strict QoS metrics is not a trivial task for globally distributed network providers. This task becomes still harder when content popularity varies over the time and the SLA definitions have to include both transfer rate and latency metrics. Current worldwide content delivery approaches and datacenter infrastructures rely on cumbersome replication schemes that are agnostic to edge-network resources, and damage content provision. In this work we present AREN, an novel replication scheme for cloud storage on edge networks. AREN relies on a collaborative cache strategy and bandwidth reservation to adapt the replication degree according to strict SLA contracts and content popularity growth. We have evaluated the performances of replication schemes on edge networks using Caju, a content distribution system for edge networks. Compared to a non-collaborative caching, evaluations show that AREN prevents nearly 99.8\% of all SLA violations when the storage system is heavily loaded. We also show that AREN provides a sevenfold decrease in the amount of storage usage for replicas, and it increases by roughly 20\% the aggregate bandwidth, hence accelerating content delivery.",,2012,"Silvestre, Guthemberg; Monnet, Sebastien; Krishnaswamy, Ruby & Sens, Pierre",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6413697 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2473505.2474592,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Performing accurate simulations for deadline-aware applications,"One of the most appealing aspects of cloud computing is its potential capacity of offering customized services for clients through Service Level Agreement (SLA) contracts. Emerging cloud providers are intended to provide services whose performance targets are defined by precise data transfer deadlines. Yet, enforcing strict transfer rates for cloud-like applications is not simple. This has caught system designers and analysts' interest, and drawn their attention to study and evaluate the performance of deadline-aware applications. In order to address the increasing demand for performance evaluation tools for deadline-aware simulations, we present a bandwidth scheduling component for the PeerSim simulator. Our component provides a lightweight and accurate fair-sharing of bandwidth and rate control enforcement. We assume a simple approach that does not reproduce in-depth transport protocol behaviour. Instead, our design focuses in reducing the inherent impact on the overall simulation scalability as bandwidth scheduling accuracy is improved. We have studied the scalability and bandwidth scheduling accuracy of four scheduling approaches, namely the simplest, lock-based, packet or slot-based, and connection-oriented bandwidth scheduler. We have verified that a connection-oriented approach allows us to (i) improve considerably the accuracy of fair bandwidth sharing, and (ii) implement a rate control mechanism properly.

In the testbed, provider and consumer agents act as intermediaries between providers and consumers. Through a 4-stage resource discovery process (selection, evaluation, filtering, and recommendation), a set of broker agents match consumers' requests to advertisements from providers. Following the matching of requests to resources, consumer and provider agents negotiate for mutually acceptable resource time slots.

,Flexible SLAs in the Cloud with a Partial Utility-Driven Scheduling Architecture,"Current clouds SLAs include compensation for customers (i.e. resource renters) with credits when average availability drops below a certain point. However, this credit scheme is too inflexible because consumers lose a non measurable quantity of performance and are only compensated later (i.e. in the next charging cycle). We propose to schedule cloud isolation and execution units, i.e. virtual machines (VMs), driven by the partial utility of applying a certain amount of resources (CPU, memory or bandwidth) to a given VM. This partial utility metric, specified by the customer, allows the provider to transfer resources between VMs. This is particularly relevant for private clouds where resources are not so abundant. We have defined a cost model that incorporates the partial utility the client gives to a certain level of depreciation when VMs are allocated in an over commit environment. CloudSim, a state of the art cloud simulator, was extended to support our partial utility-driven scheduling model. Using simulation scenarios with synthetic and real workloads, we show that our proposed scheduling strategy brings benefits to providers (i.e. revenue, resource utilization) and clients (i.e. workloads' execution time) by incorporating a SLA-based depreciation of computational power, allowing for more VMs to be allocated.",,2013,"Simao, Jose & Veiga, Luis",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2568486.2568496 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6753808,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,An extensibility of THEMIS billing system for the cloud computing environment,"With the advent and acceptance of cloud computing the ability to record and account for the usage of cloud resources in a convincing and capricious way has become critical for cloud service providers and users alike. The billing process involves receiving billing records from various networks, determining the billing rates associated with the billing records, calculate the cost for each billing record, aggregating this records periodically to generate invoices, sending invoices to the customer, and collecting payments received from the customer. Traditional billing systems are not enough in terms of security capabilities or computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a secure and no obstructive billing system called THEMIS as a remedy for these limitations. The system uses a novel concept of a cloud notary authority for the supervision of billing. Moreover, to provide a falsification-resistive SLA monitoring mechanism, we devised a SLA monitoring module enhanced with a trusted platform module (TPM), called S-Mon. From the perspective of extensibility, THEMIS is moreover applicable to various target services as well to improve the accountability of each service by applying more monitoring techniques to S-Mon.

,Maintaining and evolving Service Level Agreements: Motivation and case study,"Inter-organization service-oriented compositions are governed by Service Level Agreements (SLAs). While the software is maintained and evolved in response to changing business requirements or technology, the governing SLA and software configuration designed to meet this SLA do not always change in step. SLAs are negotiated and may have legal standing, which makes their maintenance expensive and time consuming. If an SLA is established that meets the requirements of the service consumer, changing the software without updating the configuration and/or the SLA may result in unmet requirements and reduced satisfaction. This paper begins by examining the business perspective on SLAs as a guide and motivation to maintaining SLAs. A simulation-driven approach to updating a configuration in step with ongoing maintenance efforts is presented. The approach is illustrated using a case study, where we examine how a configuration is updated in two maintenance scenarios: one where the application is migrated to a cloud computing platform, and another where it is migrated to use a distributed computing platform.

,Future carrier networks [Guest Editorial],"Although a huge amount of private and public research funds have been spent on future network technologies, very few research results on next generation networks are available in the literature to cater to the responsibilities of a critical communication infrastructure for future Internet with seamless mobility. Future carrier networks need to be able to scale to billions of nodes, interconnect billions of devices, and, especially, provide support for the diversified requirements of carrier grade next-generation services. The original architecture of information communications and technology (ICT) networks, and their networking protocols were not designed for supporting such requirements. Moreover, the usage context for which the mobile and fixed networks were planned has changed considerably. For instance, some of the fundamental characteristics of future carrier networks are: low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities; interoperability and federation of cloud networks with full end-to-end service level agreement (SLA) negotiations; network openness, with the possibilities of integrating network services with computing platforms and higher layers applications (e.g., over the top, OTT); and support new business models, such as network as a service (NaaS), data as a service (DaaS), and knowledge as a service (KaaS).

With the high costs of data storage devices as well as the rapid rate at which data is being generated it proves costly for enterprises or individual users to frequently update their hardware. Apart from reduction in storage costs data outsourcing to the cloud also helps in reducing the maintenance. Cloud storage moves the user's data to large data centers, which are remotely located, on which user does not have any control. However, this unique feature of the cloud poses many new security challenges which need to be clearly understood and resolved. One of the important concerns that need to be addressed is to assure the customer of the integrity i.e. correctness of his data in the cloud. As the data is physically not accessible to the user the cloud should provide a way for the user to check if the integrity of his data is maintained or is compromised. In this paper we provide a scheme which gives a proof of data integrity in the cloud which the customer can employ to check the correctness of his data in the cloud. This proof can be agreed upon by both the cloud and the customer and can be incorporated in the Service level agreement (SLA). This scheme ensures that the storage at the client side is minimal which will be beneficial for thin clients.",,2011,"Sravan Kumar, R & Saxena, A",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5716422,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,SLA-driven workload management for cloud databases,"Despite the fast growth and increased adoption of cloud databases, challenges related to Service-Level-Agreements (SLAs) specification and management still exist. Supporting application-specific performance goals and SLAs, assigning incoming query processing workloads to the reserved resources to avoid SLA violations and monitoring performance factors to ensure acceptable QoS levels, are some of the critical tasks that have not yet been addressed by the database community. In this position paper, we argue that SLA management for cloud databases should itself be offered to developers as a cloud-based automated service. Towards this goal, we discuss the design of a framework that a) enables the specification of custom applicaton-level performance SLAs and b) offers workload management mechanisms that can automatically customize their functionality towards meeting these application-specific SLAs.",,2014,"Stamatakis, Dimokritos & Papaemmanouil, Olga",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6818324,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

The purpose of checkpoints in an SLA graph database is to assist the automated handling of SLA resources with a flexible and expressive data structure, such as a multi-relational graph. We use an abstract scenario of cloud service provisioning for the analysis of the SLA and checkpoint graph data models. The paper integrates checkpoints into the graph schema by first establishing their relationships to internal SLA elements and to service management operations. In particular, the proposed graph data schema is used for the modeling and processing of a minimal service level evaluation schema. Checkpoints perform data value comparisons and return the service level evaluation status of SLA guarantees at defined time intervals. The SLA graph database is deployed as an RDF quad-store, where checkpoints represent service resources that can be evaluated dynamically and can be defined quite flexibly.",,2014,"Stamou, Katerina; Kantere, Verena; Morin, Jean Henry; Longo, Antonella & Bochicchio, Mario",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6930550 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2680847.2681435,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,SLA-driven Federated Cloud Networking: Quality of Service for Cloud-based Software Defined Networks,"Since the cloud paradigm becomes more and more popular for the dynamic resources allocation, new techniques and performance improvements for scalability as well as new cloud services on all three layers of the cloud stack were developed. Furthermore, another well covered topic is cloud federation concerning processing power and strength. However, the flexibility of the cloud is limited in terms of network services and federated networking between autonomous cloud data-center. With the promising opportunities of Software Defined Networking (SDN), this gap can be closed and enables cloud environments to establish networking federations between autonomous data-centers and virtual network partitioning in a single cloud infrastructure. In this paper we are introducing and describing an architectural approach for a generic layered model and API based software architecture to orchestrate and federate heterogeneous networks. In particular, we present an architecture that enables Quality of Service (QoS) aware configurations of network resources in a cloud infrastructure of one data-center and federated networking between different SDN based cloud networks over and above the data-center network edge. Furthermore, this architecture uses a Service Level Agreement (SLA) protocol and language to expose Key Performance Indicators (KPI) and to negotiate appropriated QoS constrains which are applied to the virtually sliced underlying network substrate. In this way, capabilities of the orchestration and the current utilization of the network are building the foundation for dynamic negotiated SLAs and the within guaranteed QoS of network resources.

,EntomoModel: Understanding and Avoiding Performance Anomaly Manifestations,"Subtle implementation errors or mis-configurations in complex Internet services may lead to performance degradations without causing failures. These undiscovered performance anomalies afflict many of today's systems, causing violations of service-level agreements (SLAs), unnecessary resource over provisioning, or both. In this paper, we re-inserted realistic anomaly causes into a multi-tier Internet service architecture and studied their manifestations. We observed that each cause had certain workload and management parameters that were more likely to trigger manifestations, hinting that such parameters could be effective classifiers. This observation held even when anomaly causes manifested differently in combination than in isolation. Our study motivates EntomoModel, a framework for depicting performance anomaly manifestations. EntomoModel uses decision tree classification and a design-driven performance model to characterize the workload and management policy settings under which manifestations are likely. EntomoModel enables online system management that avoids anomaly manifestations by dynamically adjusting system management parameters. Our trace-driven evaluations show that manifestation avoidance based on EntomoModel, or entomophobic management, can reduce 98th percentile SLA violations by 67\% compared to an anomaly oblivious adaptive approach. In a cloud computing scenario with elastic resource allocation, our approach uses less than half of the resources needed in static over-provisioning.",,2010,"Stewart, Christopher; Shen, Kai; Iyengar, Arun & Yin, Jian",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1906481.1906508 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5581612 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.180.4550,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

To foster the development of distributed cloud-based workflow engines and novel repair algorithms, workflow engines have to be modularized in order to overcome the static and inflexible APIs provided by these workflow engines. Dynamic features gained by a modularization include the creation of external modules to monitor as well as modify a workflow to provide error handling in conjunction with service level agreement (SLA) constraints.

,A Service Level Agreement for the Resource Transaction Risk Based on Cloud Bank Model,Cloud computing is a new business computing model. The environment of the resources is very complex. The resources are physically distributed and connected by the network. There are many risks existing in the resource transactions. So how to make sure that the cloud computing platform can avoid these risks during the transactions and assure the quality of services (QoS) provided to the consumers is a very important issue in cloud computing. Service Level Agreement (SLA) is proposed to solve the problems between the customers and service suppliers. Cloud Bank model [1] is a resource management model based on economic principles and aims at solving all the commercial level problems in cloud computing. This paper presents a framework of Service Level Agreement based on the Cloud Bank's liquidity risk [2] predicting model.

At this paper, we would enhance our previous method to make FTR-HTTP can work and communicate with server that implemented virtual machine as usually used at cloud computing.

,A solution for implementing resilience in open source Cloud platforms,"SlapOS is the first open source operating system for Distributed Cloud Computing. SlapOS is based on a grid computing daemon - called slapgrid - which is capable of installing any software on a PC and instantiate any number of processes of potentially infinite duration of any installed software. Slapgrid daemon receives requests from a central scheduler - the SlapOS Master - which collects back accounting information from each process. SlapOS Master follows an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) model to handle at the same time process allocation optimization and billing. Recent research on Cloud Computing has focused on the implementation of Service Level Agreements (SLA) and operation of large Data Centers. However, in case of Force Majeure such as natural disaster, strike, terrorism, unpreventable accident, etc., Service Level Agreements (SLA) no longer apply. Rather than centralizing Cloud Computing resources in large data centers, Distributed Cloud Computing resources are aggregated from a grid of standard PCs hosted in homes, offices and small data centers.",,2012,"Suciu, George; Cernat, Cristian; Todoran, Gyorgy; Suciu, Victor; Poenaru, Vlad; Militaru, Traian & Halunga, Simona",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6262565,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,DPack: Disk scheduler for highly consolidated cloud,"Virtualization allows us to consolidate multiple servers onto a single physical machine, saving infrastructure cost. Yet, consolidation can lead to performance degradation, jeopardizing Service Level Agreement (SLA). In this paper, we analyze and identify the factors to the performance degradation due to consolidation - that is the wait time and the ready time. The wait time is the queuing time caused by other virtual machines (VMs). The ready time is the time the resource takes to be ready to service, such as the seek time incurred in traditional storage. The ready time can substantially deteriorate the request response time. Unfortunately, existing schedulers can only manage the wait time, but not the ready time. To control both quantities, we propose an adaptive disk scheduler called DPack. DPack schedules the VMs based on the likelihood of the VM failing the SLAs. DPack then adjusts the exclusive access time based on the VM resource access prediction. DPack considers the workload changes and request arrival to enhance robustness. We develop DPack based on the default disk scheduler in KVM and evaluate it against several existing disk schedulers available in KVM and Xen. The results show that DPack can improve the 99th percentile response time up to 76\%. In the highly consolidated environment, DPack can also satisfy all the SLAs, while the other schedulers cannot meet the SLAs for at least 50\% of the VMs.",,2013,"Sukwong, Orathai & Kim, Hyong S.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6566729,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SageShift: Managing SLAs for highly consolidated cloud,"Maximizing consolidation ratio, the number of virtual machines (VMs) in a physical machine, without violating customers' SLAs is an important goal in the cloud. We show that it is difficult to achieve this goal with existing hypervisor schedulers. The schedulers control only the amount of resource allocation, but not the sequence of VM execution. This sequence can significantly impact the response time when requests arrive concurrently for the VMs sharing the same CPU. We find that the response time can increase as much as 100\% for every additional VM in the system, even if the utilization does not exceed the maximum capacity. Therefore, existing schedulers have to reduce the consolidation ratio to meet SLAs. Previous resource-provisioning works rely on existing schedulers that cannot guarantee SLAs without reducing the consolidation ratio. We propose SageShift, a system that can achieve SLAs without penalizing the consolidation ratio. SageShift consists of a VM admission control - Sage, and a hypervisor scheduler - Shift. To admit a VM, Sage assesses feasibility of its SLA based on the patterns of incoming requests. Shift maintains the admitted SLAs by adjusting both the amount of resource allocation and the sequence of VM execution. The dynamic adjustment is based on the observed response time and the SLAs. We modify the KVM scheduler in Linux kernel to implement Shift. We show that Shift can improve the consolidation ratio by 66\% without compromising the SLAs. Under bursty incoming requests, Shift maintains all SLAs within 3\% of the percentile target. But existing schedulers in VMware ESXi, Xen and KVM fail to meet one or more SLAs with up to 33\% below the percentile target. Shift is also work-conserving. It allows best-effort VMs to run in the background in order to maximize hardware utilization without impacting SLAs.",,2012,"Sukwong, Orathai; Sangpetch, Akkarit & Kim, Hyong S.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6195591,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Benchmarking Private Cloud Performance with User-Centric Metrics,"Cloud computing is a new paradigm for the delivery of IT services. It has enabled many promising opportunities for features that cannot be easily implemented in traditional IT environments, such as elastic scalability, self-service deployment, resiliency and recovery, and so forth. Benchmarking the cloud requires a well-defined set of cloud performance metrics that should be able to sensitively distinguish the capabilities of cloud systems that enable those features. One way of defining benchmark metrics is based on observations of the internal mechanisms in a cloud. For example, an elasticity evaluation may be based on measuring a resource provisioning interval in the cloud. However, a more meaningful evaluation should be based on user-centric metrics. In this article, we will introduce a set of performance metrics that can be directly measured, calculated and compared by the cloud users, including workload consumers and the users who deploy and manage the workload life cycles. We will also discuss ways to organize the user-centric metrics, with different emphasis, into a benchmark that represents different use cases.",,2014,"Sun, Bin; Hall, Brian; Wang, Hu; Zhang, Da Wei & Ding, Kai",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2624303.2624590 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6903488,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

However, in some critical business scenario, service failures and performance violations need to be proactively prevented instead of recovery triggered by the occurrence of those failures. In this paper, a proactive detective control model is proposed to prevent workflow SLA violation supported by the utilization of SLA utility functions and control charts.

,Heuristics based server consolidation with residual resource defragmentation in cloud data centers,"Server Consolidation is one of the foremost concerns associated with the effective management of a Cloud Data Center as it has the potential to accomplish significant reduction in the overall cost and energy consumption. Most of the existing works on Server Consolidation have focused only on reducing the number of active physical servers (PMs) using Virtual Machine (VM) Live Migration. But, along with reducing the number of active PMs, if a consolidation approach reduces residual resource fragmentation, the residual resources can be efficiently used for new VM allocations, or VM reallocations, and some future migrations can also be reduced. None of the existing works have explicitly focused on reducing residual resource fragmentation along with reducing the number of active PMs to the best of our knowledge.

,ArA: Adaptive resource allocation for cloud computing environments under bursty workloads,"Cloud computing nowadays becomes quite popular among a community of cloud users by offering a variety of resources. However, burstiness in user demands often dramatically degrades the application performance. In order to satisfy peak user demands and meet Service Level Agreement (SLA), efficient resource allocation schemes are highly demanded in the cloud. However, we find that conventional load balancers unfortunately neglect cases of bursty arrivals and thus experience significant performance degradation. Motivated by this problem, we propose new burstiness-aware algorithms to balance bursty workloads across all computing sites, and thus to improve overall system performance. We present a smart load balancer, which leverages the knowledge of burstiness to predict the changes in user demands and on-the-fly shifts between the schemes that are “greedy” (i.e., always select the best site) and “random” (i.e., randomly select one) based on the predicted information. Both simulation and real experimental results show that this new load balancer can adapt quickly to the changes in user demands and thus improve performance by making a smart site selection for cloud users under both bursty and non-bursty workloads.",,2011,"Tai, Jianzhe; Zhang, Juemin; Li, Jun; Meleis, Waleed & Mi, Ningfang",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.298.2771 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6108060 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2358951.2359089,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Information-centric Networking (ICN) realizes a rich networking layer with ability to support computing and caching usable by any application. The success of ICN depends on enabling new services for which an ICN-based edge service framework was proposed. This paper extends our proposal by elaborating on service functions to enable contextual interaction between users and services. Towards this, an overview of the proposed ICN-based edge cloud framework is provided, with comprehensive discussion on service composition, orchestration, and routing logic with mapping to resources in the underlying substrate. In this work, we elaborate on an ICN perspective of a self managing network.

,A Framework for Amazon EC2 Bidding Strategy under SLA Constraints,"With the recent introduction of Spot Instances in the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), users can bid for resources and, thus, control the balance of reliability versus monetary costs. Mechanisms and tools that deal with the cost-reliability tradeoffs under this scheme are of great value for users seeking to reduce their costs while maintaining high reliability. In this paper, we propose a set of bidding strategies under several service-level agreement (SLA) constraints. In particular, we aim to minimize the monetary cost and volatility of resource provisioning. Essentially, to derive an optimal bidding strategy, we formulate this problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Based on this model, we are able to obtain an optimal randomized bidding strategy through linear programming. Using real Instance price traces and workload models, we compare several adaptive checkpointing schemes in terms of monetary costs and job completion time.

,A distributed storage system allowing application users to reserve I/O performance in advance for achieving SLA,"Performance assurance has become an important aspect in grid and cloud computing which provide services over the Internet, and Service Level Agreements (SLA) are frequently contracted between users and the service providers. However, the I/O performance of the storage or data access service is still provided on a best effort basis. Some distributed storage systems implement performance reservation, but the reservation is implemented inside of the storage and works in an adaptive manner. In order to promise performance guarantees to users, we propose a distributed storage system allowing application users to explicitly make an advanced and time-based reservation for I/O access and storage space. Thus the requested performance is guaranteed during the reserved time. This paper describes our proposed concept and the design architecture of the storage system, including the reservation interface, resource management and I/O control frameworks. Then it explains our prototype which implements a simple resource allocation strategy and I/O control of the storage network along the design. The experiment results using the prototype are also shown.

,Energy-aware online scheduling: Ensuring quality of service for IaaS clouds,"This work focuses on the analysis of energy-efficient algorithms for online scheduling in the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) type of Cloud computing. The scheduling model is based on service levels that guarantee the quality of service. Each service level is associated to a price per unit of job execution time and a slack factor, which determines the deadline for delivering the results. Once a batch job is submitted to the system, the provider has to decide whether the arriving job can be accepted or must be rejected and processed on external resources. The system maintains the quality of service guarantees for all already accepted jobs. After proposing an original formulation of the problem, we study various schedulers that provide good compromise between income maximization and power consumption minimization. Our experiments and analysis have shown that we can generate schedules with power consumption reduction without degrading the service quality.",,2014,"Tchernykh, Andrei; Lozano, Luz; Bouvry, Pascal; Pecero, Johnatan E.; Schwiegelshohn, Uwe & Nesmachnow, Sergio",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6903786,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Mapping of Cloud Standards to the Taxonomy of Interoperability in IaaS,"The idea behind cloud computing is to deliver Infrastructure-, Platform- and Software-as-a-Service (IaaS, PaaS and SaaS) over the Internet on an easy pay-per-use business model. However, current offerings from cloud providers are based on proprietary technologies. As a consequence, consumers run into a risk of a vendor lock-in with little flexibility in moving their services to other providers. This can hinder the advancement of cloud computing to small- and medium-sized enterprises. To address these issues, standardization efforts have to take place in order to support further developments in the clouds. Standardized exchange mechanisms and interfaces are crucial in order to facilitate interoperability. In this paper, we look at several cloud standards, such as Open Virtualization Format, Open Cloud Computing Interface, and Cloud Data Management Interface, and analyze them against a taxonomy in order to point out their role for interoperability in IaaS.

,A combined frequency scaling and application elasticity approach for energy-efficient cloud computing,"Energy management has become increasingly necessary in large-scale cloud data centers to address high operational costs and carbon footprints to the environment. In this work, we combine three management techniques that can be used to control cloud data centers in an energy-efficient manner: changing the number of virtual machines, the number of cores, and scaling the CPU frequencies. We present a feedback controller that determines an optimal configuration to minimize energy consumption while meeting performance objectives. The controller can be configured to accomplish these goals in a stable manner, without causing large oscillations in the resource allocations. To meet the needs of individual applications under different workload conditions, the controller parameters are automatically adjusted at runtime based on a system model that is learned online. The potential of the proposed approach is evaluated in a video encoding scenario. The results show that our combined approach achieves up to 34\% energy savings compared to the constituent approaches—core change, virtual machine change, and CPU frequency change policies, while meeting the performance target.",,2014,"Tesfatsion, S.K.; Wadbro, E. & Tordsson, J.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210537914000481,,SLA and Cloud

,Revenue Models for Streaming Applications over Shared Clouds,"When multiple users execute their streaming applications over a shared Cloud infrastructure, the provider typically captures the Quality of Service (QoS) for each application at a Service Level Agreement (SLA). Such an SLA identifies the cost that a user must pay to achieve the required QoS, and a penalty that must be paid to the user in case the QoS cannot be met. Assuming the maximisation of the revenue as the provider's objective, then it must decide: (i) which user streams to accept for storage and analysis; (ii) how many (computational / storage) resources to allocate to each stream in order to improve overall revenue and minimise cost. In this paper, we analyse revenue models for in-transit streaming applications, executed over a shared Cloud infrastructure under the presence of faulty computational resources. We propose an architecture that features a token bucket process envelop to accept user streams; and a control loop to enable resource allocation, while minimising operational cost.",,2012,"Tolosana-calasanz, Rafael; Banares, Jose Angel; Pham, Congduc; Rana, Omer F. & Ba\ {n}ares, Jos\'{e} \'{A}ngel",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.258.7364 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2357487.2357628 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6280327,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A novel scheduling approach of e-learning content on cloud computing infrastructure,"E-learning ecosystem based on cloud computing infrastructure constantly gains a popularity in a wide research and consumer popularity. There are multiple reasons for this, including the dynamic adaptability of clouds to the changing demands, their ability to provide resources per need basis and the support for virtualization. By additionally bringing the robust security and chargeback model in it, the cloud becomes a real next generation engine for all e-learning aspects, including database, application and web layers. However, and especially in a hybrid public cloud environments, the right allocation scheme of an e-learning content is critical if the given service level agreement has to be fulfilled. It is by far not enough to distribute content accordingly to the provided amount of processing power of computational nodes and corresponding storage systems. If the content scheduler does not take into account the throughput of the network communication links, the whole system become saturated with waiting times and the response of the cloud based e-learning system degrades. Our approach is to consider both processing power of computational nodes and communication links. The idea is to minimize SLEM, the magnitude of the second largest eigenvalue of the positive symmetric square matrix with elements representing time activities of computational nodes and communication links in parallel processing environment. It shows that this minimization problem can be recast as a semi-definite optimization problem, with ability to find an optimal load distribution of e-learning content.",,2011,"Tomic, D.; Muftic, O. & Biocic, B.",,,SLA and Cloud
,CSLAM: A framework for cloud service level agreement management based on WSLA,"With impressive progress of cloud computing and its influence on many aspects of utility computing, many of companies and enterprises are tending to this new product of information technology; some of these companies are interested in consuming cloud services and others tend to provide cloud services. The most common thing for these two major classes of users is service level agreements (SLAs) which are set between them. Many frameworks have been introduced for SLA management in web service level, but there are few applicable frameworks that are specific for cloud computing services. In this paper, we propose a framework for SLA management in cloud computing and especially inter-cloud environments. This framework is based on WSLA which is introduced by IBM, but we have changed it to fit into cloud computing environments. This framework is in fact a component of the cloud computing framework which we have introduced in our previous work. In this paper we are not going to provide a list of cloud service SLA parameters; instead, we propose a framework to manage cloud service SLAs and metrics.",,2012,"Torkashvan, Milad & Haghighi, Hassan",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6483055,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A goal-oriented approach for adaptive SLA monitoring: A cloud provider case study,"We argue in this paper that autonomic systems need to make their integrated monitoring adaptive in order to improve their “comprehensive” Quality of Service (QoS). We propose to design this adaptation based on high level objectives (called goals) related to the management of both the “functional system QoS” and the “monitoring system QoS”. Starting from some previous works suggesting a model-driven adaptable monitoring framework composed of 3 layers (configurability, adaptability, governability), we introduce a methodology to identify the functional and monitoring high level goals (according to the agreed Service Level Agreement - SLA) in order to drive models' instantiation. This proposal is first applied to a cloud provider case study for which two high level goals are developed (respect metrics freshness and minimize monitoring cost), and then simulated to show how the quality of management decisions, as well as intelligent monitoring of dynamic SLA, could be improved.",,2013,"Toueir, Antoine; Broisin, Julien & Sibilla, Michelle",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6842223,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Binomial distribution approach for efficient detection of service level violations in cloud,"Optimum usage of hardware devices, network devices, software resources and consistent quality of service is the aim of cloud computing. Thus, cloud computing is reducing the cost and mounting the revenue for cloud provider. Cloud computing gives the choice and freedom to cloud consumer for the use of dynamic and elastic services as pay-per-use model. In this context, to justify the cost and to verify the quality of services, active Service Level Management is required. Moreover to overcome unrealistic demands from customers and to surpass the occurring violations, a strong and straight forward approach is needed, through which SLA violations can be noticed, detected and distinguished. In this Paper, we have focused on fundamental elements for effective SLA violations detection system. We also propose an approach for binomial distribution for Service level agreement violation detection.

,A Novel Model for Competition and Cooperation among Cloud Providers,"Having received significant attention in the industry, the cloud market is nowadays fiercely competitive with many cloud providers. On one hand, cloud providers compete against each other for both existing and new cloud users. To keep existing users and attract newcomers, it is crucial for each provider to offer an optimal price policy which maximizes the final revenue and improves the competitive advantage. The competition among providers leads to the evolution of the market and dynamic resource prices over time. On the other hand, cloud providers may cooperate with each other to improve their final revenue. Based on a service level agreement, a provider can outsource its users' resource requests to its partner to reduce the operation cost and thereby improve the final revenue. This leads to the problem of determining the cooperating parties in a cooperative environment. This paper tackles these two issues of the current cloud market. First, we solve the problem of competition among providers and propose a dynamic price policy. We employ a discrete choice model to describe the user's choice behavior based on his obtained benefit value. The choice model is used to derive the probability of a user choosing to be served by a certain provider. The competition among providers is formulated as a noncooperative stochastic game where the players are providers who act by proposing the price policy simultaneously. The game is modelled as a Markov Decision Process whose solution is a Markov Perfect Equilibrium. Then, we address the cooperation among providers by presenting a novel algorithm for determining a cooperation strategy that tells providers whether to satisfy users' resource requests locally or outsource them to a certain provider. The algorithm yields the optimal cooperation structure from which no provider unilaterally deviates to gain more revenue. Numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed models.",,2014,"Truong-Huu, Tram & Tham, Chen-Khong",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6811199,,SLA and Cloud
,Hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements,"IT-based Service Economy requires Service Markets to flourish for the trade of services. A market does not represent a simple buyer-seller relationship, rather it is the culmination point of a complex chain of stake-holders with a hierarchical integration of value along each point in the chain. To enable a Service Economy, Service Markets must be practically realized, which in turn requires an enabling infrastructure to support service value chains and service choreographies resulting from service composition scenarios. In such scenarios, services compose together hierarchically in a producer–consumer manner to form service supply-chains of added value. Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are defined at various levels in this hierarchy to ensure the expected quality of service for different stakeholders. Automation of service composition directly implies the aggregation of their corresponding SLAs. In this paper we elaborate on the requirements of hierarchical aggregation of SLAs corresponding to service choreographies leading to business models such as Business Value Networks. During the hierarchical aggregation of SLAs, certain SLA information pertaining to different stakeholders is meant to be restricted and can be only partially revealed to a subset of their business partners. We introduce the concept of SLA-Views to protect such privacy concerns. We then formalize the notion of SLA Choreography and define an aggregation model based on SLA-Views to enable the automation of hierarchical aggregation of Service Level Agreements. The aggregation model has been designed to comply with the WS-Agreement standard.",,2011,"Ul Haq, Irfan; Huqqani, Altaf Ahmad & Schikuta, Erich",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X11000139 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1982689.1982825,Elsevier Science Publishers B.

To achieve this, we allow cloud customer to choose between different security levels when negotiating the SLA and then our automated SLA engine finds the requirements from the SSLA and deploys the Virtual Machine (VM) based on that. Finally, we also provide monitoring of the security services from where the customer can review the current security status of the VMs. If there are any violations from the agreed SSLA, then the customer can immediately notice that and file a SLA breach complaint to the CSP.",,2014,"Ullah, Kazi Wali & Ahmed, Abu Shohel",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6846490,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Differentiated Availability in Cloud Computing SLAs,"Cloud computing is the new trend in service delivery, and promises large cost savings and agility for the customers. However, some challenges still remain to be solved before widespread use can be seen. This is especially relevant for enterprises, which currently lack the necessary assurance for moving their critical data and applications to the cloud. The cloud SLAs are simply not good enough. This paper focuses on the availability attribute of a cloud SLA, and develops a complete model for cloud data centers, including the network. Different techniques for increasing the availability in a virtualized system are investigated, quantifying the resulting availability. The results show that depending on the failure rates, different deployment scenarios and fault-tolerance techniques can be used for achieving availability differentiation. However, large differences can be seen from using different priority levels for restarting of virtual machines.",,2011,"Undheim, Astrid; Chilwan, Ameen & Heegaard, Poul",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2082076.2082099 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6076508,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Performance and Power Management for Cloud Infrastructures,"A key issue for Cloud Computing data-centers is to maximize their profits by minimizing power consumption and SLA violations of hosted applications. In this paper, we propose a resource management framework combining a utility-based dynamic Virtual Machine provisioning manager and a dynamic VM placement manager. Both problems are modeled as constraint satisfaction problems. The VM provisioning process aims at maximizing a global utility capturing both the performance of the hosted applications with regard to their SLAs and the energy-related operational cost of the cloud computing infrastructure. We show several experiments how our system can be controlled through high level handles to make different trade-off between application performance and energy consumption or to arbitrate resource allocations in case of contention.",,2010,"Van, Hien Nguyen; Tran, Fr\'{e}d\'{e}ric Dang & Menaud, Jean-Marc",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1844768.1845355 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5557975,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SLA-Aware Virtual Resource Management for Cloud Infrastructures,"Cloud platforms host several independent applications on a shared resource pool with the ability to allocate computing power to applications on a per-demand basis. The use of server virtualization techniques for such platforms provide great flexibility with the ability to consolidate several virtual machines on the same physical server, to resize a virtual machine capacity and to migrate virtual machine across physical servers. A key challenge for cloud providers is to automate the management of virtual servers while taking into account both high-level QoS requirements of hosted applications and resource management costs. This paper proposes an autonomic resource manager to control the virtualized environment which decouples the provisioning of resources from the dynamic placement of virtual machines. This manager aims to optimize a global utility function which integrates both the degree of SLA fulfillment and the operating costs. We resort to a constraint programming approach to formulate and solve the optimization problem.

,Secured data destruction in cloud based multi-tenant database architecture,"Cloud computing falls into two general categories. Applications being delivered as service and hardware and data centers that provides those services [1]. Cloud storage evolves from just a storage model to a new service model where data is being managed, maintained, and stored in multiple remote severs for back-up reasons. Cloud platform server clusters are running in network environment and it may contain multiple users' data and the data may be scattered in different virtual data centers. In a multi-user shared cloud computing platform users are only logically isolated, but data of different users may be stored in same physical equipment. These equipments can be rapidly provisioned, implemented, scaled up or down and decommissioned. Current cloud providers do not provide the control or at least the knowledge over the provided resources to their customers. The data in cloud is encrypted during rest, transit and back-up in multi tenant storage. The encryption keys are managed per customer. There are different stages of data life cycle Create, Store, Use, Share, Archive and Destruct. The final stage is overlooked [2], which is the complex stage of data in cloud. Data retention assurance may be easier for the cloud provider to demonstrate while the data destruction is extremely difficult. When the SLA between the customer and the cloud provider ends, today in no way it is assured that the particular customers' data is completely destroyed or destructed from the cloud provider's storage. The proposed method identifies way to track individual customers' data and their encryption keys and provides solution to completely delete the data from the cloud provider's multi-tenant storage architecture. It also ensures deletion of data copies as there are always possibilities of more than one copy of data being maintained for back-up purposes. The data destruction proof shall also be provided to customer making sure that the owner's data is completely removed.",,2014,"Vanitha, M. & Kavitha, C.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6921774,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,High-Performance Cloud Computing: A View of Scientific Applications,"Scientific computing often requires the availability of a massive number of computers for performing large scale experiments. Traditionally, these needs have been addressed by using high-performance computing solutions and installed facilities such as clusters and super computers, which are difficult to setup, maintain, and operate. Cloud computing provides scientists with a completely new model of utilizing the computing infrastructure. Compute resources, storage resources, as well as applications, can be dynamically provisioned (and integrated within the existing infrastructure) on a pay per use basis. These resources can be released when they are no more needed. Such services are often offered within the context of a service level agreement (SLA), which ensure the desired quality of service (QoS). Aneka, an enterprise cloud computing solution, harnesses the power of compute resources by relying on private and public clouds and delivers to users the desired QoS. Its flexible and service based infrastructure supports multiple programming paradigms that make Aneka address a variety of different scenarios: from finance applications to computational science.

,Optimizing run-time SOA governance through context-driven SLAs and dynamic monitoring,"End-users increasingly demand the provisioning of secure, scalable, reliable, flexible, resilient, and cost-efficient infrastructures, platforms, and software. However, the preservation of these properties, particularly in SOA and cloud environments, is extremely affected by distributed, heterogeneous, transient, and volatile context information. We envision the implementation of governance feedback loops, an innovative approach that equips service-oriented systems with run-time governance capabilities able to control the fulfillment of service level agreements (SLA) under changing execution environments. However, the effectiveness of our approach depends on the capability of governance infrastructures to guarantee the consistency between monitoring strategies, governance objectives, and context situations. To advance our vision, this paper proposes (i) contextual RDF graphs, a machine-readable specification of monitoring requirements that enable governance feedback loops with dynamic context monitoring capabilities; and (ii) context-driven SLAs, an extension of SLAs where context requirements are explicitly mapped to service level objectives (SLO) to optimize the run-time control of contracted obligations.",,2011,"Villegas, Norha M.; Muller, Hausi A. & Tamura, Gabriel",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6049036,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Survey of Trust in Workflows and Relevant Contexts,"With the fast-growing Internet technology, several service-based interactions are prevalent and appear in several forms such as e-commerce, content provider, Virtual Organizations, Peer-to-Peer, Web Service, Grids, Cloud Computing, and individual interactions. This demands for an effective mechanism to establish trust among participants in a high-level abstract way, capturing relevant factors ranging on Service Level Agreement, security policies, requirements, regulations, constraints, Quality of Service, reputation, and recommendation. Trust is platform-independent and flexible to be seamlessly integrated into heterogeneous domains and interoperate with different security solutions in distributed environments. Establishing trust in a service workflow leads to the willingness of services to participate. Coordinating service workflows without trust consideration may pose higher risks, possibly results in poor performance, additional vulnerabilities, or failures. Although trust in service workflows and relevant contexts has been studied for a past decade, the standard development is still immature. Nowadays, trust approaches to service workflows comprise a large area of research where one can hardly classify into a comprehensive survey. This survey examines and explores the role of trust in service workflows and their contexts from a wide variety of literatures.

,A Unified Management Model for Data Intensive Storage Clouds,"Cloud storage has recently appeared as a promising solution to handle the immense volume of data produced in nowadays' rich and ubiquitous digital environment. Existing approaches, however, do not fully address certain significant issues, such as Service Level Agreements, which tend to be rudimentary, and management of cloud systems, which often lacks sophistication. In this paper, we propose the definition and development of management models that systematically describe the resources, services, usage, and requirements in the context of a cloud storage environment. Furthermore, we introduce content oriented SLA Schemas, which are adapted according to the content term involved in each SLA. Combining all this often heterogeneous information in a smart, structured, and uniform manner can provide significant added value, allowing correlations, links and extraction of useful inferences. We thus propose to incorporate these models in a rich Unified Management Model, which will contribute to optimum decision making, data movement, as well as better resource allocation and energy management, also leading to enhanced Quality of Service.

,Tracking the PRIME eddy using satellite altimetry,"The PRIME cruise to the North Atlantic during June/July 1996 surveyed and sampled an extremely vigorous and deep-reaching eddy with a significant barotropic component. Although it exhibited anticyclonic flow and featured a warm core at depth, it had been capped at some point during its lifetime, so appeared as a cold feature in the upper 500m. Satellite-derived sea-surface temperatures (SST) showed it to have moved little during the few weeks prior to the cruise. In this paper we discuss the origin of the PRIME eddy including where and when it is likely to have formed. Consistently large amounts of cloud cover restrict the use of SST imagery to track such features. Altimetry provides a better method to trace this eddy back in time and space since microwave radiation is not significantly affected by cloud cover. Sea-level anomaly (SLA) data from the TOPEX/POSEIDON and European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites were used. Results show that the eddy remained almost stationary in the Iceland Basin since first being detected in late 1995 and that it almost certainly formed locally, probably as a result of an instability in the current flow around the northwest of the Hatton Bank. Comparisons between satellite SLAs and hydrographic estimates of sea-surface elevation confirm that the eddy had a substantial barotropic flow. Both the altimeter data and the sea-surface height derived from the acoustic Doppler current profiler agree that the PRIME eddy had a sea-surface elevation of about 20cm and that its diameter was about 120km.",,2001,"Wade, Ian P. & Heywood, Karen J.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064500000941,,SLA and Cloud

The objective is to manage resource use to just satisfy the performance requirements of clients and avoid the common over-provisioning or under-provisioning problem. The proposed resource management method makes initial resource leasing plan based on client request profile and performance targets in service level agreements (SLAs). It then dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on monitoring data.

,A genetic-based approach to web service composition in geo-distributed cloud environment,"Independent fine-grain web services can be integrated to a value-added coarse-grain service through service composition technologies in Service Oriented Architecture. With the advent of cloud computing, more and more web services in cloud may provide the same function but differ in performance. In addition, the development of cloud computing presents a geographically distributed manner, which elevates the impact of the network on the QoS of composited web services. Therefore, a significant research problem in service composition is how to select the best candidate service from a set of functionally equivalent services in terms of a service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we propose a composition model that takes both QoS of services and cloud network environment into consideration. We also propose a web service composition approach based on genetic algorithm for geo-distributed cloud and service providers who want to minimize the SLA violations.",,2014,"Wang, Dandan; Yang, Yang & Mi, Zhenqiang",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790614002419,,SLA and Cloud
,Avoiding performance fluctuation in cloud storage,"Cloud computing is an elastic computing model whereby users can lease computing and storage resources on demand from a remote infrastructure. Cloud computing is gaining popularity due to its low cost, high reliability and wide availability. However, a serious impediment to its wider deployment is the relative lack of effective data management services. The relatively slow access to persistent data and large variability in cloud storage I/O performance, can significantly degrade the performance of data-intensive applications. This paper addresses the problem of I/O performance fluctuation and proposes an automatic optimization schema for cloud storage called AOSC, which utilizes data chunking, placement, and replication to achieve more stable and predictable performance. Our experimental results based on Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) data center show that AOSC can improve the stability and help provide better performance guarantees for cloud computing.",,2010,"Wang, Jianzong; Varman, Peter & Xie, Changsheng",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5713182,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Hierarchical Memory Service Mechanism in Server Consolidation Environment,"Increasing Internet business and computing footprint motivate server consolidation in data centers. Through virtualization technology, server consolidation can reduce physical hosts and provide scalable services. However, the ineffective memory usage among multiple virtual machines (VMs) becomes the bottleneck in server consolidation environment. Because of inaccurate memory usage estimate and the lack of memory resource managements, there is much service performance degradation in data centers, even though they have occupied a large amount of memory. In order to improve this scenario, we first introduce VM's memory division view and VM's free memory division view. Based on them, we propose a hierarchal memory service mechanism. We have designed and implemented the corresponding memory scheduling algorithm to enhance memory efficiency and achieve service level agreement. The benchmark test results show that our implementation can save 30\% physical memory with 1\% to 5\% performance degradation. Based on Xen virtualization platform and balloon driver technology, our works actually bring dramatic benefits to commercial cloud computing center which is providing more than 2,000 VMs' services to cloud computing users.",,2011,"Wang, Liufeng; Wang, Huaimin; Cai, Lu; Chu, Rui; Zhang, Pengfei & Liu, Lanzheng",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2117686.2118693 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6121258,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

With the development of cloud computing, more and more cloud service providers emerge. However, there are no metrics can be referred to compare these providers, so it is difficult for cloud consumers to select the most reliable providers or resources. Thus we present a platform of Services Level Agreement (SLA) in cloud computing.

,Response Time Reliability in Cloud Environments: An Empirical Study of n-Tier Applications at High Resource Utilization,"When running mission-critical web-facing applications (e.g., electronic commerce) in cloud environments, predictable response time, e.g., specified as service level agreements (SLA), is a major performance reliability requirement. Through extensive measurements of n-tier application benchmarks in a cloud environment, we study three factors that significantly impact the application response time predictability: bursty workloads (typical of web-facing applications), soft resource management strategies (e.g., global thread pool or local thread pool), and bursts in system software consumption of hardware resources (e.g., Java Virtual Machine garbage collection). Using a set of profit-based performance criteria derived from typical SLAs, we show that response time reliability is brittle, with large response time variations (order of several seconds) depending on each one of those factors. For example, for the same workload and hardware platform, modest increases in workload burstiness may result in profit drops of more than 50\%. Our results show that profitbased performance criteria may contribute significantly to the successful delimitation of performance unreliability boundaries and thus support effective management of clouds.",,2012,"Wang, Qingyang; Kanemasa, Yasuhiko; Li, Jack; Jayasinghe, Deepal; Kawaba, Motoyuki & Pu, Calton",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.304.4651 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2477173.2477523 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6424878,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Game Theoretic Framework of SLA-based Resource Allocation for Competitive Cloud Service Providers,"Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that allows the on-demand delivering of software, hardware, and data as services. It has attracted a lot of attention recently due to the increasing demand for high performance computing and storage. Resource allocation is one of the most important challenges in the cloud computing system, especially when the clients have some Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and the total profit depends on how the system can meet these SLAs. A set of multiple cloud service providers (CSPs) in the cloud, such as Google or Amazon, may support the similar type of application, and therefore, service requests generated from the network edges are free to be dispatched to any CSP in the set. This paper considers the problem of SLA-based resource provisioning and management among different CSPs. Each CSP owns a set of potentially heterogeneous servers supporting a common application type, and each performs resource allocation in these servers for request processing. In the cloud, a central request dispatcher allocates service requests to different servers (belonging to potentially different CSPs) based on the amounts of allocated resources in those servers. Each CSP optimizes its own profit, which is the total revenue obtained from servicing the clients subtracted by the total energy cost. The total revenue depends on the average service request response time as specified in the SLAs. The resource allocation problem among multiple CSPs forms a competitive normal-form game, since the payoff (profit) of each CSP depends not only on its own resource allocation results but also on the actions of the other CSPs. The existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium in this game are proved. Each CSP will find its optimal strategy at the Nash equilibrium point using the convex optimization technique. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the game theoretic resource provisioning framework for the CSPs.",,2014,"Wang, Yanzhi; Lin, Xue & Pedram, Massoud",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6824621 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2634428.2634526,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

We propose a resource allocation algorithm that minimizes the overall cloud operation cost, while satisfying required service-level agreements (SLAs).

,SLA-Based Resource Allocation for Software as a Service Provider (SaaS) in Cloud Computing Environments,"Cloud computing has been considered as a solution for solving enterprise application distribution and configuration challenges in the traditional software sales model. Migrating from traditional software to Cloud enables on-going revenue for software providers. However, in order to deliver hosted services to customers, SaaS companies have to either maintain their own hardware or rent it from infrastructure providers. This requirement means that SaaS providers will incur extra costs. In order to minimize the cost of resources, it is also important to satisfy a minimum service level to customers. Therefore, this paper proposes resource allocation algorithms for SaaS providers who want to minimize infrastructure cost and SLA violations. Our proposed algorithms are designed in a way to ensure that Saas providers are able to manage the dynamic change of customers, mapping customer requests to infrastructure level parameters and handling heterogeneity of Virtual Machines. We take into account the customers' Quality of Service parameters such as response time, and infrastructure level parameters such as service initiation time.

,Automated SLA Negotiation Framework for Cloud Computing,"A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a legal contract between parties to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS) are provided the providers to the customers. A SLA negotiation between participants assists in defining the QoS requirements of critical service-based processes. However, the negotiation process for customers is a significant task particularly when there are multiple SaaS providers in the Cloud market, as service cost and quality are constantly changing and consumers have varying needs. Therefore, we propose a novel automated negotiation framework where a SaaS broker is utilized as the one-stop-shop for customers to achieve the required service efficiently when negotiating with multiple providers. The automated negotiation framework facilitates intelligent bilateral bargaining of SLAs between a SaaS broker and multiple providers to achieve different objectives for different participants. To maximize profit and improve customer satisfaction levels for the broker, we propose the design of counter offer generation strategies and decision making heuristics that take into account time, market constraints and trade-off between QoS parameters. Our negotiation heuristics are evaluated by extensive experimental studies of our framework using data from a real Cloud provider.",,2013,"Wu, Linlin; Garg, Saurabh Kumar; Buyya, Rajkumar & Versteeg, S.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6546098 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.294.4687,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,SLA-based Resource Provisioning for Software-as-a-Service Applications in Cloud Computing Environments,"Cloud computing is a solution for addressing challenges such as licensing, distribution, configuration, and operation of enterprise applications associated with the traditional IT infrastructure, software sales and deployment models. Migrating from a traditional model to the Cloud model reduces the maintenance complexity and cost for enterprise customers, and provides on-going revenue for Software as a Service (SaaS) providers. Clients and SaaS providers need to establish a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to define the Quality of Service (QoS). The main objectives of SaaS providers are to minimize cost and to improve Customer Satisfaction Level (CSL). In this paper, we propose customer driven SLA-based resource provisioning algorithms to minimize cost by minimizing resource and penalty cost and improve CSL by minimizing SLA violations. The proposed provisioning algorithms consider customer profiles and providers' quality parameters (e.g., response time) to handle dynamic customer requests and infrastructure level heterogeneity for enterprise systems. We also take into account customer-side parameters (such as the proportion of upgrade requests), and infrastructure-level parameters (such as the service initiation time) to compare algorithms.

To serve their customers, SaaS providers utilise resources of internal data centres or rent resources from a public Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider. In-house hosting can increase administration and maintenance costs whereas renting from an IaaS provider can impact the service quality due to its variable performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose innovative admission control and scheduling algorithms for SaaS providers to effectively utilise public Cloud resources to maximize profit by minimizing cost and improving customer satisfaction level. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive evaluation study to analyse which solution suits best in which scenario to maximize SaaS providerʼs profit.

Cloud computing, due to its dynamic structure and property in online services, differs from current data centers in terms of power management. To better manage the power consumption of web services in cloud computing with dynamic user locations and behaviors, we propose a power budgeting design based on the logical level, using a distribution tree.

Intelligently managing and allocating resources among various clients is important for system providers, whose business model relies on managing the infrastructure resources in a cost-effective manner while satisfying the client service level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we address the issue of how to intelligently manage the resources in a shared cloud database system and present SmartSLA, a cost-aware resource management system. SmartSLA consists of two main components: the system modeling module and the resource allocation decision module. The system modeling module uses machine learning techniques to learn a model that describes the potential profit margins for each client under different resource allocations. Based on the learned model, the resource allocation decision module dynamically adjusts the resource allocations in order to achieve the optimum profits. We evaluate SmartSLA by using the TPC-W benchmark with workload characteristics derived from real-life systems. The performance results indicate that SmartSLA can successfully compute predictive models under different hardware resource allocations, such as CPU and memory, as well as database specific resources, such as the number of replicas in the database systems.

,Economical and Robust Provisioning of N-Tier Cloud Workloads: A Multi-level Control Approach,"Resource provisioning for N-tier web applications in Clouds is non-trivial due to at least two reasons. First, there is an inherent optimization conflict between cost of resources and Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Second, the resource demands of the multiple tiers can be different from each other, and varying along with the time. Resources have to be allocated to multiple (virtual) containers to minimize the total amount of resources while meeting the end-to-end performance requirements for the application. In this paper we address these two challenges through the combination of the resource controllers on both application and container levels. On the application level, a decision maker (i.e., an adaptive feedback controller) determines the total budget of the resources that are required for the application to meet SLA requirements as the workload varies. On the container level, a second controller partitions the total resource budget among the components of the applications to optimize the application performance (i.e., to minimize the round trip time). We evaluated our method with three different workload models -- open, closed, and semi-open - that were implemented in the RUBiS web application benchmark. Our evaluation indicates two major advantages of our method in comparison to previous approaches. First, fewer resources are provisioned to the applications to achieve the same performance. Second, our approach is robust enough to address various types of workloads with time-varying resource demand without reconfiguration.",,2011,"Xiong, Pengcheng; Wang, Zhikui; Malkowski, Simon; Wang, Qingyang; Jayasinghe, Deepal & Pu, Calton",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2014697.2014787 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.245.1758 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5961734,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

The approach lends itself to the application of real-time autoconfiguration of clouds. It also makes it possible to adapt the VM resource budget and appliance parameter settings to the cloud dynamics and the changing workload to provide service quality assurance. In particular, the approach has the flexibility to make a good trade-off between system-wide utilization objectives and appliance-specific SLA optimization goals.

,iAware: Making Live Migration of Virtual Machines Interference-Aware in the Cloud,"Large-scale datacenters have been widely used to host cloud services, which are typically allocated to different virtual machines (VMs) through resource multiplexing across shared physical servers. Although recent studies have primarily focused on harnessing live migration of VMs to achieve load balancing and power saving among different servers, there has been little attention on the incurred performance interference and cost on both source and destination servers during and after such VM migration. To avoid potential violations of service-level-agreement (SLA) demanded by cloud applications, this paper proposes iAware, a lightweight interference-aware VM live migration strategy. It empirically captures the essential relationships between VM performance interference and key factors that are practically accessible through realistic experiments of benchmark workloads on a Xen virtualized cluster platform. iAware jointly estimates and minimizes both migration and co-location interference among VMs, by designing a simple multi-resource demand-supply model. Extensive experiments and complementary large-scale simulations are conducted to validate the performance gain and runtime overhead of iAware in terms of I/O and network throughput, CPU consumption, and scalability, compared to the traditional interference-unaware VM migration approaches. Moreover, we demonstrate that iAware is flexible enough to cooperate with existing VM scheduling or consolidation policies in a complementary manner, such that the load balancing or power saving can still be achieved without sacrificing performance.",,2014,"Xu, Fei; Liu, Fangming; Liu, Linghui; Jin, Hai; Li, Bo & Li, Baochun",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6598665,,SLA and Cloud

Customers of these composite services can make an advance payment before consumption. In this scenario, accounting systems will supervise each service comprising given composite services individually. As the number of constituent services and requests submitted by customers increase dramatically, scalability issues arise. To tackle this problem, we present an approach that estimates the highest cost of a given composite service composed of multiple pre-paid services, and then calculates the duration of a time interval based on which accounting systems access and update target customers' account. It is intended to reduce overhead imposed by supervising services individually in real-time.

Hence Cloud data center could provide infrastructure capabilities in a more energy efficient way. However, there exists a tradeoff between energy efficiency and application service level objectives. It is challenging to realize effective energy consumption and energy efficiency aware autonomic cloud application service level agreement assurance mechanism. In this paper, we propose energy aware cloud application management architecture for private cloud data center. Furthermore we present a cloud application and power management model. In order to metering server energy utility efficiency and cloud applications' total energy consumption of running on a specific group of servers, we define related measurement metrics.

,Wide area tentative scaling (WATS) for quick response in distributed cloud computing,"As cloud computing is increasingly adopted by enterprises, a stringent service level agreement such as response time is required by the cloud in order to run business applications. This can be problematic because activity from geographically distributed terminals owing to globalization often increases the average response time. Federating various clouds enables to utilize datacenters in various geographical regions regardless of their servicers. The response time can be reduced by replicating the applications and related data at datacenters near the terminals by considering the factors of delay (e.g., data synchronization, distribution of multi-tier applications, and influence of other applications). However, it is unrealistic to accurately analyze all of the factors without any errors. We propose wide area tentative scaling (WATS) to improve the response time in a phased manner by repetitively replicate a part of the application and related data at other datacenters and selecting a better organization. The WATS approach is to repetitively change the organization to reduce the response time even if the analysis is incorrect, unlike mathematical-formulae-based approaches that require precise analysis. The drawback of this approach is that it consumes more computing resources due to repeating the replication.

,iMeter: An integrated VM power model based on performance profiling,"The unprecedented burst in power consumption encountered by contemporary datacenters continually boosts the development of energy efficient techniques from both hardware and software perspectives to alleviate the energy problem. The most widely adopted power saving solutions in datacenters that deliver cloud computing services are power capping and VM consolidation. However, without the capability to track the VM power usage precisely, the combined effect of the above two techniques could cause severe performance degradation to the consolidated VMs, thus violating the user service level agreements. In this paper, we propose an integrated VM power model called iMeter, which overcomes the drawbacks of overpresumption and overapproximation in segregated power models used in previous studies. We leverage the kernel-based performance counters that provide accurate performance statistics as well as high portability across heterogeneous platforms to build the VM power model. Principal component analysis is applied to identify performance counters that show strong impact on the VM power consumption with mathematical confidence. We also present a brief interpretation of the first four selected principal components on their indications of VM power consumption. We demonstrate that our approach is independent of underlying hardware and virtualization configurations with clustering analysis. We utilize the support vector regression to build the VM power model predicting the power consumption of both a single VM and multiple consolidated VMs running various workloads. The experimental results show that our model is able to predict the instantaneous VM power usage with an average error of 5\% and 4.7\% respectively against the actual power measurement.",,2014,"Yang, Hailong; Zhao, Qi; Luan, Zhongzhi & Qian, Depei",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13001532,,SLA and Cloud

,Workload Predicting-Based Automatic Scaling in Service Clouds,"Service platforms have disadvantages such as they have long construction periods, low resource utilizations and isolated constructions. Migrating service platforms into clouds can solve these problems. The scalability is an important characteristic of service clouds. With the scalability, the service cloud can offer on-demand capacities to different services. In order to achieve the scalability, we need to know when and how to scale virtual resources assigned to different services. In this paper, a linear regression model is used to predict the workload. Based on this predicted workload, an auto-scaling mechanism is proposed to scale virtual resources at different resource levels in service clouds. The automatic scaling mechanism combines the real-time scaling and the pre-scaling. Finally experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our approach can satisfy the user SLA while keeping scaling costs low.",,2013,"Yang, Jingqi; Liu, Chuanchang; Shang, Yanlei; Mao, Zexiang & Chen, Junliang",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6740226 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2514940.2515052,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Many trust technologies such as SLA, cloud audit, self-assessment questionnaire, accreditation, and so on, are proposed by some research organizations like CSA. However, all of these just provide a initial trust and have many limitations. A hybrid trust service architecture for cloud computing is proposed in this paper, which primary includes two trust modules named the initial trust module and trust-aided evaluation module. After an initial and a basic trust is established in initial trust module, the trust-aided evaluation module will be used to verify the service provider dependable further.

,Accountability as a Service for the Cloud: From Concept to Implementation with BPEL,"Summary form only given. Accountability in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a capability of making business processes across all participants (services, applications and people) accountable in terms of both business logic and Quality of Services (QoS). While accountability is a critical mechanism to enhance trust between collaborative services, there is the lack of standard accountability support in the current SOA infrastructure. For example, it is difficult with the existing technologies/infrastructure to resolve a dispute between two (web) services if some interactions between the two services go wrong; there is also little existing accountability support for a service consumer to collect quantity evidences to complain a service provider, who fails to meet its Service Level Agreement (SLA). As the increasing real-world activities are performed through the Internet connected services, we envision that there will be growing requirements for making the behaviors of both service providers and consumers accountable. In the business world, one may be reluctant to transact directly with a stranger. But a mutually trusted middleman can be used to facilitate transactions and resolve possible disputes. In this tutorial, we will share our observations and research results on building accountability into SOA. First, we will review related work on accountability in traditional distributed systems, ranging from Internet protocols and network file systems to outsourced database management systems. We will examine what methods embodied in these work can fit service computing in Internet scale and what cannot. Then we will present our research work on middleman-based approach to delivering accountability as a service, including our recent research results. This tutorial will focus on the major technical challenges of enabling SOA accountable and our solutions to these challenges. Finally, we will demonstrate our solutions using a collaborative services scenario deployed in - - Amazon EC\^{}2 cloud. The goal of this tutorial is to provide detailed understanding of accountability issues and related technologies in SOA with in-depth related work discussions, recent research outcomes and a deployed accountability service prototype.",,2010,"Yao, Jinhui; Chen, Shiping; Wang, Chen; Levy, David & Zic, John",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5575581,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,Optimal Negotiation of Service Level Agreements for Cloud-Based Services through Autonomous Agents,"Cloud-based services have become a cornerstone of today's IT. The self-service feature inherent in Cloud systems allows customers to play a greater role in service procurement. However, this restricts the value propositions and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that Cloud providers offer because Quality of Service (QoS) and Non Functional Property (NFP) requirements vary from customer to customer. In feature-rich SLA templates, the contract space gets large, objectives are confidential and preferences over QoS and NFP often conflict between providers and customers. Hence, an SLA-gap exists between the two and contemporary providers bind their offerings to the inflexible take-it-or-leave-it SLAs. In this work, we address this problem by presenting a robust and computationally inexpensive negotiation strategy, using which agents can efficiently create near-optimal SLAs under time constraints. Experimental evaluations validate that our strategy performs at par with state of the art learning and non-learning strategies against a variety of metrics including utility, social welfare, social utility and the Pareto-optimal bids. This enables a dynamic SLA negotiation mechanism on top of our OpenShift (PaaS) based Cloud system designed using Service Oriented Cloud Computing Infrastructure (SOCCI) architecture.

The controller facilitates the elastic provisioning of applications using a combination of adapting the resource constraints of VMs and dynamically plugging in new virtual CPUs. We have implemented our design and evaluated our approach using real world workload traces from the RUBiS online auction benchmark.

,Profit-driven resource scheduling for virtualized cloud systems,"Virtualized resource renting is a key issue in IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) cloud systems. Suitable resource allocation improves resource utilization and increases profit for application providers. The application provider will obtain better revenues according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA), if they rent more virtual resources. However, they will invest much more capital for renting these virtual resources. How many resources a provider rents has become a key thing for cloud applications. This paper addresses the reconciliation objectives by proposing a profit-driven resource scheduling method for virtualized cloud systems. Compared with traditional methods, our method aims at maximizing the revenues by introducing SLA and the cost of renting cloud resource, instead of increasing resource utilization or decreasing early finishing time. We model the performance of applications with queueing theory; calculate the revenues according to the SLA and renting cost; adjust the amount of virtual resources to adapt to dynamic workloads in period. We have implemented a framework for scheduling virtual resources, and applied it in our IaaS cloud platform OnceCloud.

,SLA-driven dynamic resource provisioning for service provider in cloud computing,"Cloud Computing provides a convenient means of remote and pay-per-use access to computing resources in forms of Virtual Machines (VMs). Specially, with cloud computing, service providers no longer need to maintain a large number of expensive physical machines, which can significantly reduce the cost. However, due to the fluctuation and uncertainty of the future demands, it is still a challenge for service providers to dynamically determine the optimal resource provisioning to save cost while guaranteeing the Service Level Agreement (SLA). Overload may result in the service unavailable for the latter service requests while over-provisioning naturally increases the cost. To address the problem, in this paper, by defining the unavailability probability of the service as a metric of SLA, we propose a SLA-driven dynamic VMs provisioning strategy based on the large deviation principle, which is capable of proactive calculating the optimal number of VMs for the upcoming demands subject to the unavailability probability below a desired threshold. Finally, the experiments are performed based on real workload traces to show the attainable performance of the proposed resource provisioning strategy and verify that the proposed strategy can make a good tradeoff between saving cost and guaranteeing SLA.",,2013,Yongyi Ran; Jian Yang; Shuben Zhang & Hongsheng Xi,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6825022,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

As Cloud resources are elastic and resource demands of database requests are unpredictable, it is challenging to decide when and where to place databases in Cloud environment according to their resource requirements. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient placement algorithm striving to produce placement solution that optimizes multiple objectives considering multi-resource constraints, user preferences and system preferences. The objective is to help DBaaS providers to achieve effective resource allocation among multiple databases, minimize the disturbance to the system caused by database migration, and maximize Cloud resource utilization.

,A penalty-based grouping genetic algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud,"Software as a Service (SaaS) in Cloud is getting more and more significant among software users and providers recently. A SaaS that is delivered as composite application has many benefits including reduced delivery costs, flexible offers of the SaaS functions and decreased subscription cost for users. However, this approach has introduced a new problem in managing the resources allocated to the composite SaaS. The resource allocation that has been done at the initial stage may be overloaded or wasted due to the dynamic environment of a Cloud. A typical data center resource management usually triggers a placement reconfiguration for the SaaS in order to maintain its performance as well as to minimize the resource used. Existing approaches for this problem often ignore the underlying dependencies between SaaS components. In addition, the reconfiguration also has to comply with SaaS constraints in terms of its resource requirements, placement requirement as well as its SLA. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes a penalty-based Grouping Genetic Algorithm for multiple composite SaaS components clustering in Cloud. The main objective is to minimize the resource used by the SaaS by clustering its component without violating any constraint.

The question of how to handle the runtime uncertainties for GPU resource sharing remains unanswered. To address this challenge, we propose vGASA, a virtualized GPU resource adaptive scheduling algorithm in cloud gaming. vGASA interposes scheduling algorithms in the graphics API of the operating system, and hence the host graphic driver or the guest operating system remains unmodified. To fulfill the service level agreement as well as maximize GPU usage, we propose three adaptive scheduling algorithms featuring feedback control that mitigates the impact of the runtime uncertainties on the system performance.

Different from existing centralized control approaches, the workload management logic hierarchically spreads on each back-end server and front-end proxy. The control solution is designed to offer both overload protection and resource efficiency for the back-end servers, while achieving service differentiation based on Service Level Agreement (SLA). The proposed system can directly work with legacy software stack, because the implementation requires no changes to the target operating system, application servers, or web applications.

,A Relationship-Based VM Placement Framework of Cloud Environment,"Managing computation resources in a cost-effective way has become the core competence for a Cloud provider to win over the market because of the ""pay-as-you-go"" business model. Therefore, VM placement has become more and more important in the research and practices of VM management by determining at what condition and on which physical server a VM should be placed so that the SLA can be guaranteed and servers' utilization can be improved. Much existing work simply formulates the above issue to be a bin-packing problem, which does not take the VM relationships into account. However, the relationship information can greatly impact the SLA of the Cloud system and the resource utilization. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a relationship-based VM placement framework, SmartCRS, to optimize the VM placement procedure. SmartCRS reveals the relationships between VMs automatically. Then by using such information and based on a constraint library, it gives a proper VM placement plan. Finally, the plan is carried out by SmartCRS automatically or by Cloud administrators manually to improve the server utilization and guarantee the required SLA.

Our approach not only contributes to improving the monitoring accuracy, but also takes less overhead during the communication.

,An adaptive power management framework for autonomic resource configuration in cloud computing infrastructures,"Power is becoming an increasingly important concern for large-scale cloud computing systems. Meanwhile, cloud service providers leverage virtualization technologies to facilitate service consolidation and enhance resource utilization. However, the introduction of virtualization makes the cloud infrastructure more complex, and thus challenges cloud power management. In a virtualized environment, resource needs to be configured at runtime at the cloud, server and virtual machine levels to achieve high power efficiency. In addition, cloud power management should guarantee high users' SLA (service level agreement) satisfaction. In this paper, we present an adaptive power management framework in the cloud to achieve autonomic resource configuration. We propose a software and lightweight approach to accurately estimate the power usage of virtual machines and cloud servers. It explores hypervisor-observable performance metrics to build the power usage model. To configure cloud resources, we consider both the system power usage and the SLA requirements, and leverage learning techniques to achieve autonomic resource allocation and optimal power efficiency.

Due to dynamic and flexibility in cloud environment, Service Level Agreement (SLA) plays a crucial role in guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) level agreed by participants. Though lots of work on SLA management, few of them have adapted well in such an environment. In this study, we present a novel policy-based adaptive approach to solve the problem, and introduce a contract template embedded with policy to handle the changes of service provision and participants' requirement. In this way, we illustrate how the policy enables adaptive SLA management. This approach dynamically perceives alterations of SLAs parameters and adjusts them accordingly. Thus, service providers can maximize the resources and consumers could get the best price. Finally, our proposal is evaluated and its advantages are shown.",,2014,"Zhang, Zhenling; Liao, Lejian; Liu, Hai & Li, Guoqiang",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6933614,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A statistical based resource allocation scheme in cloud,"Recently, cloud computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm on the Internet. With the development of cloud computing, enterprise data centers shift towards a utility computing model where many critical business applications share a common pool of infrastructure resources offering capacity on demand. The virtual machine with the features of strong isolation and flexible is usually assigned as the basic unit. However, as the demand of each type of VM can fluctuate independently at run time, it becomes a challenging problem to allocate data center resources to each VM to balance the workload in the cloud. In this paper, we introduce an approach (Statistic based Load Balance, SLB) that makes use of the statistical prediction and available resource evaluation mechanism to make online resource allocation decisions. Unlike the methods that balance load based on SLA (Service Level Agreement) of VMs, SLB achieves load balancing by predicting the VM's resource demand. The approach includes two parts:(1) A data analysis of on-line historical performance for forecasting the resource demand of each VM, and (2) An algorithm for choosing a proper host in the resource pool to run the VM. Experiments show that SLB can perform load balance in time, and also perform more balanced use of different resources.",,2011,"Zhang, Zhenzhong; Wang, Haiyan; Xiao, Limin & Ruan, Li",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2354417.2355564 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6138531,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offers users different Virtual Machine (VM) instances with various capacities and prices which can be used as servers in each tier of web applications. Because of heterogeneousness of workload in each tier, it poses a great challenge to choose suitable VM purchase plans for each tier as to adapt the varying workload and reduce the cost of VM usage. In this paper, we propose a new approach which conducts cost-aware dynamic VM purchase plans for multi-tier cloud applications. Our approach first uses reinforcement learning to generate several candidate plans to adapt the varying workload and then employs linear programming to find the optimal one which is the most money-saving among the candidates. The experiment results witness the proposed method gains better performance than the traditional threshold method in meeting the Service Level Agreement (SLA) and cutting down the cost.",,2013,"Zhao, He; Peng, Chenglei; Yu, Yao; Zhou, Yu; Wang, Ziqiang & Du, Sidan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2569433.2569898 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6686078,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

In the environment with sporadic and sharp swings of workload, our approach acts quickly to get suitable VM scaling scheme to stabilize the response time, reduce the SLA violations and save the rent of VM usage.",,2013,"Zhao, He; Peng, Chenglei; Yu, Yao; Zhou, Yu; Wang, Ziqiang & Du, Sidan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2546918.2547011 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6685667,IEEE,SLA and Cloud
,A Framework for Consumer-Centric SLA Management of Cloud-Hosted Databases,"Currently, we are witnessing a proliferation in the number of cloud-hosted applications with a tremendous increase in the scale of the data generated as well as being consumed by such applications. The specifications of existing service level agreements (SLA) for cloud services are not designed to flexibly handle even relatively straightforward performance and technical requirements of consumer applications. In this article, we present a novel approach for SLA-based management of cloud-hosted databases from the consumer perspective. The framework facilitates adaptive and dynamic provisioning of the database tier of the software applications based on application-defined policies for satisfying their own SLA performance requirements, avoiding the cost of any SLA violation and controlling the monetary cost of the allocated computing resources. In this framework, the SLA of the consumer applications are declaratively defined in terms of goals which are subjected to a number of constraints that are specific to the application requirements. The framework continuously monitors the application-defined SLA and automatically triggers the execution of necessary corrective actions (scaling out/in the database tier) when required. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our SLA-based framework in providing the consumer applications with the required flexibility for achieving their SLA requirements.",,2013,"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.380.3204 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6461875,,SLA and Cloud

,Application-Managed Replication Controller for Cloud-Hosted Databases,"Data replication is a well-known strategy to achieve the availability, scalability and performance improvement goals in the data management world. However, the cost of maintaining several database replicas always strongly consistent is very high. The CAP theorem shows that a shared-data system can choose at most two out of three properties: consistency, availability, and tolerance to partitions. In practice, most of the cloud-based data management systems tend to overcome the difficulties of distributed replication by relaxing the consistency guarantees of the system. In particular, they implement various forms of weaker consistency models such as eventual consistency. This solution is accepted by many new Web 2.0 applications (e.g. social networks) which could be more tolerant with a wider window of data staleness (replication delay).However, unfortunately, there are no generic application-independent and consumer-centric mechanisms by which software applications can specify and manage to what extent inconsistencies can be tolerated. We introduce an adaptive framework for database replication at the middleware layer of cloud environments. The framework provides flexible mechanisms to enable software applications of keeping several database replicas (that can be hosted in different data centers) with different levels of service level agreements (SLA) for their data freshness. The experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in providing the software applications with the required flexibility to achieve and optimize their requirements in terms of overall system throughput, data freshness and invested monetary cost.",,2012,"Zhao, Liang; Sakr, Sherif & Liu, Anna",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.380.4568 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2353730.2353821 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6253597,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,Meeting service level agreement cost-effectively for video-on-demand applications in the cloud,"Increasingly video-on-demand (VoD) applications have been ported to cloud platforms. Leveraging the elastic resource provisioning of the cloud, it is believed that VoD applications should attain high performance cost-effectively. In this paper we propose an approach that aims to solve the fundamental resource reservation and scheduling problem of configuring the cloud utility to meet SLAs for VoD applications at a modest cost. First, we devise a constraint-based model that describes the relationship among channel placement, user groups' bandwidth allocation, operating costs and QoS constraints. Second, we present a distributed heuristic algorithm, called DREAM, that solves the model and produces a budget solution that reserves and allocates cloud bandwidth, and determines the channel layout among datacenters. Simulations driven by data traces collected from a commercial VoD system demonstrate that DREAM provides much better access locality and data availability than and comparable streaming quality to state-of-the-art solutions at lower cloud operating costs.",,2014,"Zhao, Yuhong; Jiang, Hong; Zhou, Ke; Huang, Zhijie & Huang, Ping",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6847951,IEEE,SLA and Cloud

,A Cool Scheduler for Multi-Core Systems Exploiting Program Phases,"Rapid growth of cloud computing services have led to creation of large scale enterprise data centers which consume great amounts of energy. Data centers usually have an service level agreement (SLA) between the clients and the service providers, which specify the terms and quality of service to be provided. In this paper, we consider a situation in a data center where multiple user applications are executing on a multi-core system and each application may have a specified SLA requirement. We design a voltage and frequency scheduler (the “cool” scheduler) that can be used in enterprise data centers to provide CPU energy saving under the specified SLA requirement by exploiting the applications' run-time program phases. Our design greatly improves the computation efficiency compared to other recently published works. The scheduler is built into the Linux kernel and evaluated against SPEC CPU2006 and Phoronix Test Suite on a quad-core system. Experiment result demonstrates that our cool scheduler achieves 25.8\% energy saving on average with 8.7\% performance loss under the given SLA requirement (10\% allowed performance loss).

To navigate such a three-way tradeoff, we take advantage of Lyapunov optimization techniques to design and analyze a carbon-aware control framework, which makes online decisions on geographical load balancing, capacity right-sizing, and server speed scaling.

,Modelling carbon budget of Mediterranean forests using ground and remote sensing measurements,"The current paper illustrates a method to operationally apply the model FOREST-BGC for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes in Mediterranean environments. The work was carried out in a pine forest stand within the coastal area of San Rossore (Central Italy) using both conventionally collected and remotely sensed data. The calibration of the model was performed using estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) derived from the carbon accumulated in the forest stems during the last four decades. Such estimates were obtained by transforming dendrochronological measurements collected in the stand into annual increments of woody biomass and carbon matter. Next, the model performance was validated against values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) collected during four years (1999–2002) by an eddy covariance flux tower. A method based on deriving fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) from remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was also calibrated and validated in order to more directly assess forest GPP. The results achieved indicate that the multi-year calibration against past carbon accumulation was essential in properly configuring the model in terms of respiration and allocation functions. Due to the importance of these functions, only the calibrated model was in fact able to correctly simulate the forest carbon fluxes, giving monthly estimates of both NEE and GPP quite close to those measured by the flux tower. These estimates were further improved by the proper integration of remotely sensed GPP evaluation and model carbon partitioning, which could be particularly useful for operational monitoring applications on a regional scale.",,2005,"Chiesi, M.; Maselli, F.; Bindi, M.; Fibbi, L.; Cherubini, P.; Arlotta, E.; Tirone, G.; Matteucci, G. & Seufert, G.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192305002108,,SLA and DI

This service enables data integration and access on a large scale in cloud computing infrastructures. Addressing data privacy in DAAS is considered a significant issue for any organizational database. Due to the fact that data will be shared with a third party, an un-trusted server is dangerous and unsafe for the user. This paper proposes the architecture of a new model appropriate for NetDB2 architecture, known as NetDB2 Multi-Shares (NetDB2-MS).

,A decentralized access control mechanism using authorization certificate for distributed file systems,"Modern cloud systems are geo-replicated to improve application latency and availability. Transactional consistency is essential for application developers; however, the corresponding concurrency control and commitment protocols are costly in a geo-replicated setting. To minimize this cost, we identify the following essential scalability properties: (i) only replicas updated by a transaction T make steps to execute T; (ii) a read-only transaction never waits for concurrent transactions and always commits; (iii) a transaction may read object versions committed after it started; and (iv) two transactions synchronize with each other only if their writes conflict. We present Non-Monotonic Snapshot Isolation (NMSI), the first strong consistency criterion to allow implementations with all four properties. We also present a practical implementation of NMSI called Jessy, which we compare experimentally against a number of well-known criteria. Our measurements show that the latency and throughput of NMSI are comparable to the weakest criterion, read-committed, and between two to fourteen times faster than well-known strong consistencies.",,2011,"Arakawa, J. & Sasada, K.",,,DI and Cloud

,A Secure and Flexible Data Infrastructure for the VPH-Share Community,"With the advent of distributed computing, particularly since the emergence of Grids, Clouds and other Service Oriented Computing paradigms, the querying of huge datasets of distributed databases or data repositories on a global scale has become a challenging research question. Currently, beside various other topics, two major concerns in this research area have to be addressed: data access \& integration and query execution planning. Our research effort addresses the second issue, namely the query optimization of distributed database queries. Hereby we consider a variety of different heterogeneous and homogeneous infrastructures, parallel algorithms, and huge datasets, which span across several virtual organizations (VOs) with usually no centralized authority. This paper introduces a novel heuristic framework for the optimization of query execution plans (QEP) on a world-wide scale. Our work is based on a multi-staged blackboard mechanism to determine which available data, resources and operations have to be considered to perform a query optimally. Moreover, an evaluation scenario proves our findings that even small changes in the selection of e.g. sort operations for a query execution tree (QET) lead to significant performance improvements.",,2013,"Benkner, Siegfried; Kaniovskyi, Yuriy; Borckholder, Chris; Bubak, Marian; Nowakowski, Piotr; Lopez, Dario Ruiz & Wood, Steven",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2624949.2625088 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6904259,IEEE,DI and Cloud

,FOODIE — Open data for agriculture,"Data integration system (DIS) is becoming paramount when Cloud/Grid applications need to integrate and analyze data from geographically distributed data sources. DIS gathers data from multiple remote sources, integrates and analyzes the data to obtain a query result. As Clouds/Grids are distributed over wide-area networks, communication cost usually dominates overall query response time. Therefore we can expect that query performance can be improved by minimizing communication cost. In our method, DIS uses a data flow style query execution model. Each query plan is mapped to a group of $\mu$Engines, each of which is a program corresponding to a particular operator. Thus, multiple sub-queries from concurrent queries are able to share $\mu$Engines. We reconstruct these sub-queries to exploit overlapping data among them. As a result, all the sub-queries can obtain their results, and overall communication overhead can be reduced. Experimental results show that, when DIS runs a group of parameterized queries, our reconstructing algorithm can reduce the average query completion time by 32–48\%; when DIS runs a group of non-parameterized queries, the average query completion time of queries can be reduced by 25–35\%.",,2014,"Charvat, Karel; Esbri, Miguel Angel; Mayer, Walter; Campos, Antonio; Palma, Raul & Krivanek, Zbynek",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6880647,IEEE,DI and Cloud

As SODB is organized in a service-oriented manner, SODB can be easily changed or maintained by reusing different services. Thus, it can be used to share information in the cloud. The Information Sharing System (ISS) component of the SODB employs domain ontology to share data sources. The domain ontology utilizes mathematical equivalence relations to map data sources into appropriate domain ontology. It also facilitates dynamic query composition across data sources. This paper also presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of the ISS component.

,Structure inference for linked data sources using clustering,"For scalable distributed database systems, weak consistency models are essential. Distributed databases, such as Google Spanner, scale to millions of nodes that replicate data across datacentres possibly located on different continents. At this scale, it is infeasible to maintain serialisability, which assumes that a global total order over committed transactions can be established. Instead, weaker consistency models, such as eventual consistency, causal consistency, sequential consistency and external consistency, are assumed. The problem is that operational models, such as labelled transition systems, tend to assume an interleaving semantics, which serialises transactions. To address this limitation, we provide an operational model that allows a weaker notion of consistency for a geographically distributed database inspired by Spanner.

,Proceedings of the 10th ACM/IFIP/USENIX International Conference on Middleware,"With the advent of 4G and other long-term evolution (LTE) wireless networks, the traditional boundaries of patient record propagation are diminishing as networking technologies extend the reach of hospital infrastructure and provide on-demand mobile access to medical multimedia data. However, due to legacy and proprietary software, storage and decommissioning costs, and the price of centralization and redevelopment, it remains complex, expensive, and often unfeasible for hospitals to deploy their infrastructure for online and mobile use. This paper proposes the SparkMed data integration framework for mobile healthcare (m-Health), which significantly benefits from the enhanced network capabilities of LTE wireless technologies, by enabling a wide range of heterogeneous medical software and database systems (such as the picture archiving and communication systems, hospital information system, and reporting systems) to be dynamically integrated into a cloud-like peer-to-peer multimedia data store. Our framework allows medical data applications to share data with mobile hosts over a wireless network (such as WiFi and 3G), by binding to existing software systems and deploying them as m-Health applications. SparkMed integrates techniques from multimedia streaming, rich Internet applications (RIA), and remote procedure call (RPC) frameworks to construct a Self-managing, Pervasive Automated netwoRK for Medical Enterprise Data (SparkMed). Further, it is resilient to failure, and able to use mobile and handheld devices to maintain its network, even in the absence of dedicated server devices. We have developed a prototype of the SparkMed framework for evaluation on a radiological workflow simulation, which uses SparkMed to deploy a radiological image viewer as an m-Health application for telemedical use by radiologists and stakeholders. We have evaluated our prototype using ten devices over WiFi and 3G, verifying that our framework meets its two main objectives: 1) interactive delivery of medical multimedia data to mobile devices; and 2) attaching to non-networked medical software processes without significantly impacting their performance.

,Assessing NoSQL Databases for Telecom Applications,"Summary form only given, as follows. Today's organizations consume an increasing share of their computing resources as computing services, using an ondemand model and paying only for what they use. They consume cloud business applications and processes, and store and analyze vast amounts of information on cloud provisioned resources. Cloud computing is dramatically reducing the capital required to support IT operations, while bringing unprecedented openness, flexibility and access to enterprise computing. One of the paradoxes of this new environment is that openness and easy access to services and resources results in the creation of new barriers and computing silos. New 'born in the cloud' enterprises are quickly discovering the difficulty of integrating SaaS services into their daily operations in efficient, secure and reliable ways. SaaS APIs are as siloed as traditional enterprise applications, if not more. Data is still represented in heterogeneous formats and kept in multiple application stores. Thus, while access and delivery have fundamentally improved, the core problems of process and data integration remain. If anything, they are getting harder. Successful technologies for process and data integration in the cloud will differ fundamentally from existing approaches for enterprise integration. While existing approaches focus on eliminating silos and leveling access to process and information, cloud integration will acknowledge barriers as the price of extending our reach beyond the limits a single organization and focus on linking capabilities and information. Instead of reengineering processes, new process integration technology will link processes and application services offered by specialized providers, leveraging instead of replacing available processes. Instead of coercing heterogeneous information into unified schemas, the new approach to information integration will link enterprise data and open data to offer virtual access to much richer informa- ion set. New cloud integration services are already being built leveraging a collection of technologies born on the Web and also within the enterprise. They include ""low touch"" technologies such as process correlation and mining, process analytics, linked and open data, and provenance among others.

This study consolidates the data integration system, Service Orientation, and distributed processing to develop a new data integration system called Service Oriented Data Integration based on MapReduce (SODIM) that improves the system performance, especially with large number of data sources, and that can efficiently be hosted on modern dynamic infrastructures as Clouds.",,2011,"Duffy, Christopher; Leonard, Lorne; Bhatt, Gopal; Yu, Xuan & Giles, Lee",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2116264.2117590 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6130732,IEEE,DI and Cloud
,SODIM: Service Oriented Data Integration based on MapReduce,"Analogous to software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), data-as-a-service (DaaS) is used to provide data on demand to users over the Internet and is gaining popularity in the current cloud computing era. In particular, several Open Data initiatives have led to a number of data services in various formats becoming available online, and it remains a challenge to make full use of the data by transferring between and answering queries from different sources in a automatic, dynamic and meaningful manner. In this paper we propose a service-oriented, composition-based approach towards tackling the integration of open data services. We provide a formal, semantic-based modeling of data services and convert the integration problem into the service composition problem. Then the composition graph can be used to create the executable queries to the various data services. We illustrate our idea by using a case study in the real estate domain.",,2013,"ElSheikh, Ghada; ElNainay, Mustafa Y.; ElShehaby, Saleh & Abougabal, Mohamed S.",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S111001681300029X,,DI and Cloud

A hybrid cloud computing model is proposed to connect all health care facilities together at a national scale. However, due to the heterogeneity of clinical database schemas, a novel technique is needed for solving the problem of data heterogeneity such that all health care providers are capable of sharing electronic health records easily.

Requirements are collected from manufacturing companies and combined with insights from literature in the field of current ERP/MES system drawbacks, advantages, needs and challenges. The findings show that the needs and challenges in data integration inside SME networks are closely related to the limitations of current supply chain solutions. Current ERP-solutions lack extended enterprise support and a shared cloud-based approach. On the other hand, current MES solutions can operate the manufacturing process, but not for distributed manufacturing. As an answer to the requirements, we made a proposal for the core of architecture for next generation of MES solution in this position paper.

The coordinated services improve wellness management and operational outcomes but pose challenges on privacy when integrating multiple sources of personal health data and providing a data access and sharing mechanism to third party providers. In this paper, we particularly address the privacy challenges associated with data integration and sharing in a multi-tenant cloud environment for healthcare. We present three care coordination use cases and detail the functional requirements across different stages of a personal data service cycle.

,Datalog and Emerging Applications: An Interactive Tutorial,"With the recent adoption and diffusion of the data sharing paradigm in distributed systems such as online social networks or cloud computing, there have been increasing demands and concerns for distributed data security. One of the most challenging issues in data sharing systems is the enforcement of access policies and the support of policies updates. Ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is becoming a promising cryptographic solution to this issue. It enables data owners to define their own access policies over user attributes and enforce the policies on the data to be distributed. However, the advantage comes with a major drawback which is known as a key escrow problem. The key generation center could decrypt any messages addressed to specific users by generating their private keys. This is not suitable for data sharing scenarios where the data owner would like to make their private data only accessible to designated users. In addition, applying CP-ABE in the data sharing system introduces another challenge with regard to the user revocation since the access policies are defined only over the attribute universe. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel CP-ABE scheme for a data sharing system by exploiting the characteristic of the system architecture. The proposed scheme features the following achievements: 1) the key escrow problem could be solved by escrow-free key issuing protocol, which is constructed using the secure two-party computation between the key generation center and the data-storing center, and 2) fine-grained user revocation per each attribute could be done by proxy encryption which takes advantage of the selective attribute group key distribution on top of the ABE. The performance and security analyses indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient to securely manage the data distributed in the data sharing system.",,2011,"Huang, Shan Shan; Green, Todd Jeffrey & Loo, Boon Thau",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.259.6748 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.229.2143 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1989323.1989456,ACM Press,DI and Cloud

,Hybrid Cloud For Dummies,"Due to great advances in computing and Internet technologies, organizations have been enabled to collect and generate a large amount of data. Most of these organizations tend to analyze their data to discover new patterns. Usually, analyzing such amount of data requires huge computational power and storage facilities that may not be available to these organizations. Cloud computing offers the best way to solve this problem. Storing the private data of different organizations in the same cloud server enhances the mining process, but at the same time, raises privacy concerns. Therefore, it is highly recommended to support privacy preserving data mining algorithms in the cloud environment. This paper introduces an efficient and accurate cryptography-based scheme for mining the cloud data in a secure way without loss of accuracy. Specifically, we address the problem of K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classification over horizontally distributed databases without revealing any unnecessary information. We have utilized the recently developed cryptography primitive, order preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE), to integrate securely the local classifications at a lower cost than the previously presented privacy preserving data mining schemes. Empirical results on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme has similar performance with the naive mining systems in terms of classification accuracy.",,2012,"Hurwitz, Judith; Kaufman, Marcia; Halper, Fern & Kirsch, Dan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2385826,For Dummies,DI and Cloud

,Distributed data-parallel computing using a high-level programming language,"The emergence of technologies such as XML, web services and cloud computing have helped, the proliferation of databases and their diversity pose serious barriers to meaningful information extraction from these “big databases”. Research in intention recognition has also progressed substantially, yet very little has been done to recognize query intents to search, select, map and extract responses from such enormous pools of candidate databases. Query mapping becomes truly complicated particularly in scientific databases where tools and functions are needed to interpret the database contents, semantics of which are usually hidden inside the functions. In this paper, we present a declarative meta-language, called BioVis, using which biologists potentially are able to express their “intentional queries” with the expectation that a mapping function $\mu$ is able to accurately understand the meaning of the queries and map them to the underlying resources appropriately. We show that such a function is technically feasible if we can design a schema mapping function that can tailor itself according to a knowledgebase and recognize entities in schema graphs.

,Mapping abstract queries to big data web resources for on-the-fly data integration and information retrieval,"The problem of data integration throughout the lifecycle of a construction project among multiple collaborative enterprises remains unsolved due to the dynamics and fragmented nature of the construction industry. This study presents a novel cloud approach that, focusing on China’s special construction requirements, proposes a series of as-built BIM (building information modeling) tools and a self-organised application model that correlates project engineering data and project management data through a seamless BIM and BSNS (business social networking services) federation. To achieve a logically centralised single-source data structure, a unified data model is constructed that integrates two categories of heterogeneous databases through the adoption of handlers. Based on these models, key technical mechanisms that are critical to the successful management of large amounts of data are proposed and implemented, including permission, data manipulation and file version control. Specifically, a dynamic Generalised List series is proposed to address the sophisticated construction file versioning issue. The proposed cloud has been successfully used in real applications in China. This research work can enable data sharing not only by individuals and project teams but also by enterprises in a consistent and sustainable way throughout the life of a construction project. This system will reduce costs for construction firms by providing effective and efficient means and guides to complex project management, and by facilitating the conversion of project data into enterprise-owned properties.",,2014,"Jamil, Hasan M.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6818304,IEEE,DI and Cloud

,Mining events connections on the social web: Real-time instance matching and data analysis in EventMedia,"Recently the main trend in providing software services has been shifting from an ASP (application service provider)-oriented to a SaaS (software as a service). ASP is a software service model in which the service is provided on a one by one basis according its ownership, while SaaS is a software service model in which the service is provided virtually on a one by one basis, but physically all at once. In a SaaS environment, all users can access the system via Internet without any software installation—examples include Google and Amazon. Now, more companies are shifting their business software service from ASP to SaaS. However effecting the transition of the existing software and data from ASP to SaaS is not an easy task. First, we have to solve the problem of the integration of data for different forms of software, because each data set consists of different data types. Second, the software integration must support a user customizing interface for various users on the Web. Almost all users want customized services, but those require high costs. In this paper we propose a novel method for transferring the existing business software to integrated software that can be used in the SaaS environment. We use a master table and master code to implement the integrated system. The master table is based on the project master table, and other user information tables are connected to collect the necessary information. All information about the project is stored in each column of the project master table. The master table can integrate various software databases.

,Ontology Automatic Constructing Based on Relational Database,"Citizens have always played an important role in emergency management such as urban flooding response. New information and communication technologies such as smart phones and computer-based social networks have great potential to transform the roles of citizens in emergency management. However, current digital citizen science projects are usually limited in three areas: 1) limited one-way citizen participation, 2) no processing and integration of citizens' reports with other existing infrastructure sensing data, 3) no personalized near-real-time spatiotemporal visualization tools for citizens to instantly view aggregated data to gain updated situational awareness. We developed a Mapster application that specifically addresses these issues. First, we leveraged Twitter's geo-referenced tweets functionality to design a customized smart phone application for citizens to report a set of events that have been identified in past urban flooding situations such as ""basement flooding"" and ""powerline down"" etc. Second, a Cloud-based semantic streaming data harvesting and processing tool was developed to fetch and process both the Twitter feeds and other infrastructure sensing data such as US National Weather Service's radar data. Third, a user can instantly explore the heterogeneous data processed and provided by the Cloud service through a map-based spatiotemporal animation tool on the smart phone to see how all the events evolve before, during, and after a storm.

Three-layered metadata model, including data source metadata, business metadata and topic metadata, is proposed to realize heterogeneous data integration, and components and functions for each layer are introduced. Then RDF-based metadata representation is introduced for data interchange. The architecture of a typical heterogeneous data integration system based on metadata has been put forward, the applications can directly use HTTP protocol to access the broker by uniform data access interfaces based on RESTful Web Services, and the data broker provides all applications with integrated access to multiple, heterogeneous data sources, giving each client the illusion of a single, homogeneous database designed for his specific need. Metadata make it easy to query and locate data resources, and eliminate heterogeneity of multiple data sources.

,Research on three-layered metadata model for oil-gas data integration,"The concept of iPaaS is in its infancy, and very few vendors and users even recognize the term. Some see iPaaS as an evolution of integration as a service, which has been widely adopted for cloud services integration. Another point of view presents iPaaS as an emerging form of delivering application and data integration capabilities, consolidating multiple cloud services in a suite aimed at the integration and governance of any combination of on-premises and off-premises applications, within or across organizations. The iPaaS is designed to act in the middle and help connect to a number of services across the layers. Issues come from the convergence and consolidation process toward iPaaS, which will be turbulent. Many providers will disappear; in the race to leadership, vendors will bring to market immature technologies; some mergers and acquisitions will fail; some vendors will not be able to effectively scale up their platforms to support large cloud workloads; and other vendors will struggle to provide quality support to a growing number of clients.",,2011,"Ma, Zhonggui; Wang, Chengyao & Wang, Zongjie",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6045118,IEEE,DI and Cloud
,iPaaS: Different Ways of Thinking,"The analysis of rainfall and runoff to characterize watershed response to storm events is a critical area of hydrologic research. A wealth of data exists to perform this analysis, but it is not easily accessible in a central location. The United States Geological Survey currently collects stream flow data for approximately 12,000 watersheds in the United States. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration produces the spatially-distributed NEXRAD precipitation data, which can be used to estimate rainfall over an entire watershed. While the data is plentiful, it has yet to be integrated in a single system where hydrologists can easily explore the pattern of rainfall and runoff to assess watershed response.

,Security for Effective Data Storage in Multi Clouds,"Semantic inferencing and querying across large-scale RDF triple stores is notoriously slow. Our objective is to expedite this process by employing Google's MapReduce framework to implement scale-out distributed querying and reasoning. This approach requires RDF graphs to be decomposed into smaller units that are distributed across computational nodes. RDF Molecules appear to offer an ideal approach - providing an intermediate level of granularity between RDF graphs and triples. However, the original RDF molecule definition has inherent limitations that will adversely affect performance. In this paper, we propose a number of extensions to RDF molecules (hierarchy and ordering) to overcome these limitations. We then present some implementation details for our MapReduce-based RDF molecule store. Finally we evaluate the benefits of our approach in the context of the Bio-MANTA project - an application that requires integration and querying across large-scale protein-protein interaction datasets.",,,"Neetha, T.",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.303.6872,,DI and Cloud

In recent years, a growing number of companies have adopted various types of non-relational databases, commonly referred to as NoSQL databases, and as the applications they serve emerge, they gain extensive market interest. These new database systems are not relational by definition and therefore they do not support full SQL functionality. Moreover, as opposed to relational databases they trade consistency and security for performance and scalability. As increasingly sensitive data is being stored in NoSQL databases, security issues become growing concerns.

,Security Issues in NoSQL Databases,"We address the problem of building scalable transaction management mechanisms for multi-row transactions on key-value storage systems, which are commonly termed as NoSQL systems. We develop scalable techniques for transaction management utilizing the snapshot isolation (SI) model. Because the SI model can lead to non-serializable transaction executions, we investigate two conflict detection techniques for ensuring serializability. To support scalability, we investigate system architectures and mechanisms in which the transaction management functions are decoupled from the storage system and integrated with the application-level processes. We present two system architectures and demonstrate their scalability under the scale-out model of cloud computing platforms. In the first system architecture all transaction management functions are executed in a fully decentralized manner by the application processes. The second architecture is based on a hybrid approach in which the conflict detection functions are performed by a dedicated service. We perform a comparative evaluation of these architectures using the TPC-C benchmark and demonstrate their scalability.",,2011,"Okman, Lior; Gal-Oz, Nurit; Gonen, Yaron; Gudes, Ehud & Abramov, Jenny",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6120863,IEEE,DI and Cloud

,Building a Cloud Storage Service System,"This paper describes a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) mechanism for distributed High Performance Computing (HPC) systems that will facilitate scalable evaluation, management and enforcement of access control policies. The RBAC mechanism forms an enhanced security framework for Grids and Clouds that will allow for interoperability between technologies in the two domains. The mechanisms being proposed here are important because the current lack of software tools and security standards in accessing distributed HPC systems and transporting Large Data Sets can add immensely to overheads in data processing or data integration times. RBAC models make policy management scalable and by virtue of being modular allow for more sophisticated access control models to be integrated with them. This paper shows how existing security standards can be leveraged for the specification and management of RBAC policies with the aim to allow disparate applications, systems and security domains to interoperate. The extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) can be used for policy specification and management across disparate organizations and the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) can be used for authentication and authorization assertions across the same. Both standards can be leveraged to facilitate policy management and enforcement, and delegation of rights.

,RBAC for High Performance Computing Systems Integration in Grid Computing and Cloud Computing,"Two different approaches to deal with the problem of estimating soil moisture content from SAR data in the presence of vegetation are presented. They exploit also the information about the biomass provided by ancillary optical data. The first method is suitable for sparse vegetation and is founded on the application of the well-known water cloud model. As for dense vegetation canopy, we have designed a model that expresses the variation of the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil characteristics as a function of the variations of the measured backscattering coefficient and of the biomass, assuming the availability of a time series of radar and optical data. To carry out the soil moisture retrieval, a multi-temporal inversion algorithm, based on the Bayesian MAP criterion, has been developed. It integrates all the samples of the time series of SAR data corrected for the vegetation effects. The approaches were evaluated on two case studies; the first one concerning an ENVISAT/ASAR observation of an agricultural site located in Northern Italy. The second test was performed on the AirSAR data collected during the SMEX02 experiment.

As known, the federated database approach could represent a solution to data integration, but the existing solutions often don't take into account real time constraints that are more and more required by the modern e-government scenario. For this reason, in this paper a performance evaluation of relevant technologies implementing the federated database solution is done and compared with the performance of a software architecture consisting of a cloud of web services we have developed to support data integration for the administrative units of a municipal administration. The results confirm the low time performance of the federated data solutions when the integration deals with a large amount of data, whereas the proposed customizable solution shows appreciable high performance.",,2009,"Pierdicca, N.; Pulvirenti, L.; Bignami, C.; Ticconi, F. & Laurenti, M.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=5417538,IEEE,DI and Cloud
,Evaluation of federated database for distributed applications in e-government,"In environmental applications, the data have a large variety of resolutions carrying information at different scales. Various approaches have been used to include in models information from sources at different scales combining multi-resolution products in order to integrate the spatio-temporal variability of sub-pixel pattern. A methodology is proposed for the integration of the results obtained with a geostatistical downscaling algorithm, based on block-to-point-kriging, in a General Additive Models interpolation framework to enhance the spatio-temporal resolution of remote sensing data. This allows a good reproduction of the overall spatial pattern of the target images and of their local values. The developed framework was tested using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) with the thermal band of Landsat in a situation of high contamination of clouds for the high resolution dataset. The method proved to be flexible and able to blend data from different sensors maintaining the finer spatial structure of the higher resolution data. The method combines strengths from different approaches: (1) it uses of information held in covariates to provide more accurate results; (2) it is applicable to a variety of remote sensing products as the method does not rely on predetermined functional relationships; (3) it can cope with cloud-rich high resolution images as only a subset of high resolution pixels is needed. This approach is general and can be used with numerous combinations of high and low resolution images, such as MODIS-derived variables, using related band ratios from Landsat or other higher resolution sensors. This approach is a valuable addition to space–time measuring and modelling of ecosystems functions from remote sensing.",,2013,"Pino, Carmelo; Ravida, Salvatore & Scibilia, Santo",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6722791,IEEE,DI and Cloud

As a proof-of-concept, conforming to these requirements, prototype of event-based monitoring daemon is presented in detail. The resulting solution allows multiple users to consume monitoring information in an extensible data format without impairing interoperability.",,2014,"Tickle, Phil; Chan, Tai On & Lowell, Kim",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6947669,IEEE,DI and Cloud

,User perceptions of Wow experiences and design implications for Cloud services,"Today's manufacturing enterprises struggle to adopt cost-effective manufacturing systems. Overview of the recent manufacturing enterprises shows that successful global manufacturing enterprises have distributed their manufacturing capabilities over the globe. The successes of global manufacturing enterprises depend upon the entire worldwide integration of their product development processes and manufacturing operations that are distributed over the globe. Distributed manufacturing agents' collaboration and manufacturing data integrity play a major role in global manufacturing enterprises' success. There are number of works, conducted to enable the distributed manufacturing agents to collaborate with each other. To achieve the manufacturing data integrity through manufacturing processes, numbers of solutions have been proposed which one of the successful solutions is to use ISO 10303 (STEP) standard. However, adopting this standard one can recognize antonym effects of integration and collaboration approaches that weaken both integration and collaboration capabilities of manufacturing agents. In our latest work, we had developed an integrated and collaborative manufacturing platform named LAYMOD. Albeit the platform in question was through enough to be applied in various collaborative and integrated CAx systems, its embedded structure hampers its application for collaboration in distributed manufacturing systems. To achieve an integrated and collaborative platform for distributed manufacturing agents, this paper proposes a service-oriented approach. This approach is originated from cloud computing paradigm known as one of the technologies which enables a major transformation in manufacturing industry. Also, to maintain the product data integration based on the STEP standard, a new service-oriented approach is proposed. This approach is in parallel to the new capability of the STEP standard for supporting XML data structures. The result is a new platform named XMLAYMOD. XMLAYMOD is able to support distributed manufacturing collaboration and data integration based on the STEP standard. The different aspects of this platform to fulfill the requirements of distributed collaboration and also to overcome the lacks of the STEP standard are discussed through a brief case study.",,2011,"V\""{a}\""{a}n\""{a}nen-Vainio-Mattila, Kaisa; Palviainen, Jarmo; Pakarinen, Santtu; Lagerstam, Else & Kangas, Eeva",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2347504.2347573,ACM Press,DI and Cloud

,CloudTPS: Scalable Transactions for Web Applications in the Cloud,"Cloud Computing is often described as ""resources accessed via a browser over the Internet."" However, this definition has become increasingly insufficient to characterize the breadth of applications and use cases for the cloud, and the networks that must support them. A broadening range of endpoints are accessing the cloud: browser-free device apps, multimedia endpoints such as video and game consoles, sensor networks, servers, and storage. The wireline and wireless network requirements-e.g., jitter, latency, packet loss, protocol support-for these uses vary, and imply that a variety of network capabilities are sometimes necessary: e.g., MPLS for quality of service via class of service to support interactive high definition video in the cloud; optical transport for native protocols such as Fibre Channel for data integration in hybrid cloud scenarios; route control for country compliance issues. Also, distributed topologies and optimized routing are required due to application latency constraints. Moreover, wireless sensor networks and hybrid cloud scenarios such as cloudbursting that require a variety of complex distributed data approaches are driving new transport requirements: guaranteed bandwidth, dynamic bandwidth on demand, and usage-sensitive pricing for fine-grained quantities and duration of bandwidth. Cloud Computing, either as an integrated service or in support of pure-play customers must drive service providers' international telecommunications infrastructure evolution as well as BSS/OSS.",,2012,"Wei, Zhou; Pierre, Guillaume & Chi, Chi-Hung",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420624.2420744,IEEE Computer Society,DI and Cloud
,Network implications of cloud computing,"One feature of cloud storage systems is data fragmentation (or sharding) so that data can be distributed over multiple servers and sub queries can be run in parallel on the fragments. On the other hand, flexible query answering can enable a database system to find related information for a user whose original query cannot be answered exactly. Query generalization is a way to implement flexible query answering on the syntax level.

,Microsoft Dynamics CRM 4 Integration Unleashed,"MOSIS 4 NACP is a NASA-funded project supporting the North American Carbon Program (NACP). The purpose of this Advancing Collaborative Connections for Earth-Sun System Science (ACCESS) project is to provide researchers with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) biophysical data products that are custom tailored for use in NACP model studies. Standard MODIS biophysical products provide used to improve our understanding on the climate and ecosystem changes. However, direct uses of the MODIS biophysical parameters are constrained by retrieval quality and cloud contamination. Another challenge that NACP users face is acquiring MODIS data in formats and at spatial-temporal resolutions consistent with other data sets they use. We have been working closely with key NACP users to tailor the MODIS products to fit their needs. First, we provide new temporally smoothed and spatially continuous MODIS biophysical data sets. Second, we are distributing MODIS data at suitable spatial- temporal resolutions and in formats consistent with other data integration into model studies.",,2009,"Wolenik, Marc J. & Bhaiya, Rajya Vardhan",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822949,SAMS,DI and Cloud
,Improving access to MODIS biophysical science products for NACP investigators,"Due to extensive coverage and domains of cloud computing-based architecture, most users saves and access highly similar data because of user habits and available resources. Supposing the data stored in the storage devices is of high duplication and similarity, the system administrator cannot guarantee that every node (peer) in the cloud computing system can maintain the best status for data integration. Moreover, when the number of nodes keeps increasing, the number of files will be multiplied, which results to not only the system administrator's heavy workload, but also the waste of hardware resources. Finally, the flexibility and quickness of cloud storage system is gone, and what left is a lot of duplicate and redundant data. Therefore, in order to avoid the system burden caused by duplicate data, we propose novel data center management architecture: Index Name Server (INS), which integrates de-duplication and access point selection optimization techniques to enhance the performance of the cloud storage system. With the attempt to attain load balancing, we use several specific INS parameters to dynamically monitor the parameters, like IP information and busy level index, to avoid the network congestion or the long waiting time during data transmission.",,2007,"Wolfe, Robert E.; Gao, Feng; Morisette, Jeffrey T.; Ederer, Gregory A. & Pedelty, Jeffrey A.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4422972,IEEE,DI and Cloud

,Cloud analysis by modeling the integration of heterogeneous satellite data and imaging,"Cloud computing provides virtualized, dynamically-scalable computing power. At the same time, reduction of cost is also considered as an important advantage of cloud computing. Data integration can notably benefit from cloud computing because integrating data is usually an expensive task. However, existing optimization techniques pay less attention on the fact that different execution plans of the same data integration application generate different usage costs while cloud computing provides good enough performance, so this paper introduces the cost optimization of cloud-based data integration system. The data integration system's data service layer facilitates accessing and composing information from a range of enterprise data sources through data service composition. In addition, two task scheduling algorithms for parallel part and non-parallel part are proposed to minimize the usage cost required to complete the execution of composite data service when computational capability provided by cloud computing is charged. Both of the two can obtain optimal plans in polynomial time. Experiments with the system indicate that our algorithms can lead to significant cost saving over more straightforward techniques.",,2006,"Yubin Yang; Hui Lin; Jixi Jiang; Yang, Yubin; Lin, Hui & Jiang, Jixi",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2229267.2230098 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1561481,IEEE Press,DI and Cloud
,Cost Optimization of Cloud-Based Data Integration System,"Durability indicates a system's ability to preserve committed data in the long term. It is one of the key requirements for storage systems. Various fault tolerance strategies have been proposed for traditional distributed databases, peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, and grid systems. These strategies were all developed for specific platforms and application types and have been tailored to the characteristics of the underlying system architectures and application requirements. Cloud systems differ from these previous frameworks in that they are designed to support large numbers of customer-oriented applications, each with different quality of service (QoS) requirements and resource consumption characteristics. Moreover, most cloud architectures are deployed over large-scale geographically distributed infrastructures, raising challenges on data durability as well as system efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we investigated different approaches to the design of durable data cloud platforms. In particular, we consider prevailing cloud platforms and cloud-based applications and examine the impacts of different redundancy and repair strategies to enhance the durability of the data in the cloud. We verify the performance of various approaches to data durability in the Cloud through extensive simulations.",,2012,"Zhang, Peng; Han, Yanbo; Zhao, Zhuofeng & Wang, Guiling",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2420242.2420527 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6385207,IEEE,DI and Cloud
,Fault tolerance study for durable storage on the cloud,"A large number of cloud services require users to share private data like electronic health records for data analysis or mining, bringing privacy concerns. Anonymizing data sets via generalization to satisfy certain privacy requirements such as k-anonymity is a widely used category of privacy preserving techniques. At present, the scale of data in many cloud applications increases tremendously in accordance with the Big Data trend, thereby making it a challenge for commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process such large-scale data within a tolerable elapsed time. As a result, it is a challenge for existing anonymization approaches to achieve privacy preservation on privacy-sensitive large-scale data sets due to their insufficiency of scalability. In this paper, we propose a scalable two-phase top-down specialization (TDS) approach to anonymize large-scale data sets using the MapReduce framework on cloud. In both phases of our approach, we deliberately design a group of innovative MapReduce jobs to concretely accomplish the specialization computation in a highly scalable way. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that with our approach, the scalability and efficiency of TDS can be significantly improved over existing approaches.",,2011,"Zhang, Xiaofei & Chen, Lei",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6138548 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2354417.2355519,IEEE,DI and Cloud
,A Scalable Two-Phase Top-Down Specialization Approach for Data Anonymization Using MapReduce on Cloud,"An increasing amount of data is stored in cloud repositories, which provide high availability, accessibility, and scalability. However, for security reasons enterprises often need to store the core proprietary data in their own relational databases, while common data to be widely available can be stored in a cloud data repository. For example, the subsidiaries of a global enterprise are located in different geographic places where each subsidiary is likely to maintain its own local database. In such a scenario, data integration among the local databases and the cloud-based data is inevitable. We have developed a system called BigIntegrator to enable general queries that combine data in cloud-based data stores with relational databases. We present the design and working principle of the system. A scenario of querying data from both kinds of data sources is used as illustration. The system is general and extensible to integrate data from different kinds of data sources. A particular challenge being addressed is the limited query capabilities of cloud data stores. BigIntegrator utilizes knowledge of those limitations to produce efficient query execution.",,2014,"Zhang, Xuyun; Yang, Laurence T.; Liu, Chang & Chen, Jinjun",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6470603,,DI and Cloud

,Packet loss probability for DiffServ over IP and MPLS reliable homogeneous multicast networks,"Multicasting has become increasingly important with the emergence of Internet-based applications such as IP telephony, audio/video conferencing, distributed databases and software upgrading. IP multicasting is an efficient way to distribute information from a single source to multiple destinations at different locations. In practice IP is considered as a layer 3 protocol. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) replaces the IP forwarding by a simple label lookup. MPLS combines the flexibility of layer 3 routing and layer 2 switching. In order to provide QoS in group communications for real time applications such as video conferencing, reliable multicasting is used. Miscellaneous efforts have been undertaken to provide reliability on top of IP multicast. Two error control strategies have been popular in practice. These are the FEC (Forward Error Correction) strategy, which uses error correction alone, and the ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request) strategy, which uses error detection, combined with retransmission of data. In this paper, we present a new fair share policy (FSP) that utilizes Differentiated Services to solve the problems of QoS and congestion control when reliable ARQ multicast is used. The results should provide insight into the comparisons of the residual packet loss probability between IP multicast in MPLS networks using FSP and plain IP multicasting using the same policy when DiffServ are adopted and when reliable ARQ multicast is considered.",,2004,"AlWehaibi, Abdullah; Kadoch, Michael; Agarwal, Anjali & ElHakeem, Ahmed",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019004000201 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=989519.989523,"Elsevier North-Holland, Inc.",DI and QoS
,An optimized strategy for replication in Peer-to-Peer Distributed databases,"Availability of data in Distributed databases improves the QoS factors like, fault tolerance and response time. An efficient Replication management results in high degree of availability. The Replication of data among sites increases the success possibilities during the recovery. Replication is one part of the well known issue called Data Allocation Problem along with Allocation in the design phase of Distributed Databases. The Allocation improves accessibility of data. The Data Allocation Problem is a NP-Hard in its nature. Hence it requires an optimized solution for improved results. As a result of the current trends in research towards a better Allocation and Replication strategy with the usage of Optimization techniques, this paper proposes a methodology for replication of fragments in Peer-to-Peer environment with Hungarian Assignment Algorithm of optimization technique. The simulation results suggest that the population of successful queries is increased better than the initial and reallocation of fragments across the sites.",,2012,"Amalarethinam, D. I.

,Scheduling in Grid Databases,"Many global organizations are generating large volumes of highly distributed data that must be shared for querying by the organization's participants, which can be put together by a grid infrastructure. Scheduling query execution in these environment is an important issue. Centralized and hierarchical scheduling architectures are between the most commonly used scheduling architectures in distributed databases and grid computing, respectively. Each architectural model has its own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper, we evaluate the usage of both models in querying highly distributed data. We consider several scheduling policies and experimentally compare scheduling models and policies in terms of throughput and SLO-fulfillment. The obtained results indicate that layered on-demand scheduling may lead to good results in both throughput and SLO-oriented environments.",,2008,"deCarvalho Costa, Rog\'{e}rio Lu\'{\i}s & Furtado, Pedro",http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1395080.1395529 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4482997,IEEE,DI and QoS

,Perceived Consistency,"Quality of service guarantees for multimedia communication systems have been considered on several abstraction levels. In the multimedia networking field it is typical to identify the minimal QoS requirements of an application to save resources by guaranteeing its functionality. Many of these applications can operate in spite of an imperfect delivery of media data, while other applications such as distributed databases or distributed file systems consider perfect QoS necessary but accept delay. The basic problems of the latter is the consistency of their data, while the former require a consistent perception of the content. More generically, both QoS requirements can be interpreted as a problem of maintaining a consistent system state. Consequently we assume that many distributed applications, including most distributed multimedia applications, can fulfil their tasks in spite of imperfect consistency.

,A probability-based approach of transaction consistency in mobile environments,"In mobile distributed databases, the communications between sites only provide weak connectivity. To improve the efficiency of transaction processing in mobile computers, lazy replication is used extensively. But this approach either doesn't guarantee serializability and consistency as needed by applications or imposes restrictions on placement of data and which data objects can be updated. The shortcomings make it difficult for lazy replication to be adaptive to the dynamic changes of network connection and configuration in mobile environments. In the paper, we propose a probability-based approach, which guarantees serializability and consistency. We adopt the quality of service specification and achieve transaction consistency dynamically through the collaboration between applications and systems. Probability-based approach is flexible and adaptive to mobile computing environments.

,Investigating evolutionary approaches for self-adaptation in large distributed databases,"As the size of typical industrial strength databases continues to rise, particularly in the arena of the Internet and multimedia servers, the issue of managing data distribution over clusters or `farms' to overcome performance and scalability issues is becoming of paramount importance. The general objective is to manage a self-adapting distributed database so as to reliably and consistently provide near optimal performance as perceived by client applications. Such a management system must ultimately be capable of operating over a range of time varying usage profiles and fault scenarios, incorporate considerations for multiple updates and maintenance operations, and be capable of being scaled in a practical fashion to ever larger sized networks and databases. This paper investigates evolutionary computation techniques, comparing a genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, and hillclimbing on a test problem in this field. Major differential algorithm performance is found across two different fitness criteria. Preliminary conclusions are that a genetic algorithm approach seems superior to hillclimbing or annealing when the more realistic (from a quality of service viewpoint) objective function is in force. Further, the genetic algorithm approach displays regions of adequate robustness to parameter variation, which is also critical from a maintained quality of service viewpoint",,1998,"Oates, M.J.; Corne, D. & Loader, R.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=699850,IEEE,DI and QoS

,Enterprise IT support for NOAA archives,"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is responsible for archiving and disseminating environmental data collected by a variety of ground and space-based observing systems. Integrating data management across NOAA represents a significant change in NOAA business practices that will require evolution of the management structures and approaches used in NOAA for data management. Historically, archive and dissemination activities have been implemented in dedicated ""stovepipe"" systems, each focusing on the needs of a particular data collection and its associated user community. Exponential data volume growth, increasing data diversity, user requirements for common and consistent access methods across data types, and the need for economic efficiency are driving a consolidation of the information technology (IT) systems that support NOAA archives. The Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS) is a result of this consolidation; CLASS is the enterprise IT solution in support of NOAA archives. Against this backdrop, the meaning of ""archive"" is itself changing as the challenges of long-term digital preservation are better understood. It is no longer sufficient to simply preserve ""bits."" Instead, information content is the target of preservation, with ""bits"" simply providing a medium for representing information. The ISO standard ""Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System"" (OAIS-RM) provides a conceptual framework that describes the responsibilities and activities of organizations attempting to preserve digital information. Applying the OAIS-RM to NOAA's archive efforts provides the means to identify high-level archive responsibilities, delegate roles to various NOAA organizational components, and describe the means by which these entities work together to fulfill archive requirements. At the highest level, NOAA archives maintain and apply information- and user-specific knowledge while CLASS provides IT capabilities in support o- f archive activities. Together, the archives and CLASS provide the necessary ingredients to fulfill NOAA's archive mission. Currently, CLASS holds POES, DMSP, GOES, and MetOp data. Planned future campaigns include NPP, NPOESS, EOS MODIS, NEXRAD, and model and in-situ data. To ensure the preservation of these data, CLASS has implemented a multiple site distributed system that replicates data and metadata holdings automatically. Additionally, CLASS supports the deployment of ""points of presence"" that allow the co-location of key CLASS capabilities with high-volume or otherwise critical data producers or consumers to mitigate economic constraints or meet quality-of-service requirements. Among the key challenges facing CLASS are: massive increases in data volumes, the extraordinary diversity of NOAA data, evolving user needs and requirements, and the ever-changing technology environment. CLASS must address all of these challenges - and more - at the same time it ensures the safeguarding and availability of its current holdings. CLASS is evolving toward a service-oriented architecture that provides the flexibility, scalability, and generality necessary to accommodate the vast amount of change in its environment and at the same time provide interoperability with other systems and systems of systems necessary to support NOAA's position in the environmental data arena. Adoption of standards is critical to NOAA's success, and CLASS is working with NOAA's Global Earth Observation Integrated Data Environment (GEO-IDE) project to identify standards that will ensure CLASS'S interoperability with other NOAA systems. The lack of broad, uniform utilization of IT standards that adequately meet NOAA's data integration needs is arguably the most acute factor contributing to the weakness of data integration today. GEO-IDE will ultimately ensure that key NOAA systems, including CLASS, are interoperable within NOAA, with US-Global Earth Observation System (US-GEO), and ultimately w",,2007,"Rank, Robert",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4423732,IEEE,DI and QoS

Considering the huge and widely distributed amounts of data, e-science communities investigate different technologies to provide fast access to the growing data sets. Among these technologies, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and Data Grid are two models that fit these requirements well, because of their potential to provide a high quality of service with low cost. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the P2P paradigm for data-intensive e-science applications on the Grid. We argue that additional support is required to achieve fast access to the huge and widely distributed amounts of data and propose eSciGrid to overcome the scalability barriers in today’s e-science communities. eSciGrid allows e-science communities to achieve a high query throughput through a decentralized protocol which integrates caching with query processing.

Based on the ISO OSI-Reference Model analysis, rationale are presented for a reliable connectionless-mode, message due-date-dependant qualities of services and flexible conversation protocols above the transport layer. So as to support time-dependant transmission protocols, it is shown that the IEEE 802 Local Area Network standards must be enhanced in order to provide message transmission scheduling based on message due-dates.

,Multicast routing infrastructure in ATM networks,"Communication via computer networks has been growing rapidly. Technology has gained momentum. Industry, international organizations, and businesses, have started relying on networks to provide reliable, supportive, fast, and easy methods to maintain transactions between their branches. Issues such as bandwidth, scalability, and efficiency became pertinent parameters that had to be configured at all costs. Also, information needs to be sent from one site to several sites. All of this is happening on packet switched networks. With the introduction of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), the speed and quality of service of networks have increased tremendously. Still, the necessity of sending one information to several sites instantaneously has been unresolved. This research paper broadens this perspective, and introduces a new architecture for the future that will enable multicast routers to route packets. This paper also reviews the current state of multicast protocols, highlights the missing features, motivates the design, and develops the enhanced multicast protocols.

,Response Time Driven Multimedia Data Objects Allocation for Browsing Documents in Distributed Environments,"Distributed information processing, in many world wide web applications, requires access, transfer, and synchronization of large multimedia data objects (MDOs) (such as, audio, video, and images) across the communication network. Moreover, the end users have started expecting very fast response times and high quality of service. Since the transfer of large MDOs across the communication network contributes to the response time observed by the end users, the problem of allocating these MDOs so as to minimize the response time becomes very challenging. This problem becomes more complex in the context of hypermedia documents (web pages), wherein the MDOs need to be synchronized during presentation to the end users. Note that the basic problem of data allocation in distributed database environments is NP-complete. Therefore, there is a need to pursue and evaluate solutions based on heuristics which generate near-optimal MDO allocation. In this paper, we address this problem by: 1) conceptualizing this problem by using a navigational model to represent hypermedia documents and their access behavior from end users, and by capturing the synchronization requirements on MDOs, 2) formulating the problem by developing a base case cost model for response time, and generalizing it to incorporate user interaction and buffer memory constraints, 3) designing two algorithms to find near-optimal solutions for allocating MDOs of the hypermedia documents while adhering to the synchronization requirements, and 4) evaluating the trade-off between the time complexity to get the solution and the quality of solution by comparing the solutions generated by the algorithms with the optimal solutions generated through an exhaustive search.

With this report the trustworthiness of the received data can be significantly improved by documenting the data loss, semantic and syntactic errors. With the information in the report it should be possible to infer the proper value to define rules that fix the data after it has been determined to be incorrect or to find a suitable data integrations strategy into a target tool or repository.

,Approximate performance analysis of heavily loaded slotted downlink channel in a wireless CDMA system supporting integrated voice/data services,"This paper is concerned with the performance analysis of a slotted downlink channel in a wireless code division multiple access (CDMA) communication system with integrated packet voice/data transmission. The system model consists of a base station (BS) and mobile terminals (MT), each of which is able to receive voice and/or data packets. Packets of accepted voice calls are transmitted immediately while accepted multipacket data messages are initially buffered in first in, first out (FIFO) queues created separately for each destination. The BS distinguishes between silence and talkspurt periods of voice sources, so that packets of accepted data messages can use their own codes for transmission during silent time slots. To fulfill QoS requirements for both traffic types, the number of simultaneous packet transmissions over the downlink channel must be limited. To perform this task, a fair, single-priority multiqueueing scheduling scheme is employed. Discrete-time Markov processes are used to model the system operation. Statistical dependence between queues is the main difficulty which arises during the analysis. This dependence leads to serious computational complexity. The aim of this paper is to present an approximate analytical method which enables one to evaluate system performance despite the dependence. Therefore, it is assumed that the system is heavily loaded with data traffic, and a heuristic assumption is made that makes the queueing analysis computationally tractable. Typical system performance measures (i.e., the data message blocking probability, the average data throughput and delay) are evaluated, however, due to the accepted heuristic assumption, the analysis is approximate and that is why computer simulation is used to validate it.",excluded,2005,"Swiderski, J.",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=1413215 http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2215915.2216493,IEEE Press,DI and QoS
,"Topic 5 parallel and distributed databases, data mining and knowledge discovery","To manage the very large amount of data available today, computer scientists are working on efficient systems, algorithms and applications that can handle and analyze very large databases. Intensive data consuming applications are running on very large databases (on data warehouses, on multimedia databases) with the task to extract information diamonds. Data mining is one of the key applications here. However, these intensive data consuming applications suffer from performance problems and single database sources. Introducing data distribution and parallel processing help to overcome resource bottlenecks and to achieve guaranteed throughput, quality of service, and system scalability. Distributed architectures, cluster systems and P2P systems, supported by high performance networks and intelligent middleware offer parallel and distributed databases a great opportunity to support cost-effective everyday applications.

Data processing and knowledge discovery on large data sources can benefit from parallel and distributed computing both to improve performance and quality of results. Development of data mining tools on high-performance parallel computers allows for analyzing massive databases in a reasonable time. Faster processing also means that users can experiment with more models to understand complex data. Furthermore, high performance makes it practical for users to analyze greater quantities of data. Distribution of data sources and data mining tasks is another key issue that the increasing decentralization of human activities and large availability of connection facilities are making more and more critical.

We describe a class of best matching algorithms based on slicing perpendicular to the patterns and performing a modified binary search over these slices. We also analyze their complexity and performance. We then introduce schemes that allow the algorithm to ``learn'' the structure of the database and adapt itself to it. Furthermore, we show how to efficiently implement our algorithm both using general-purpose hardware and using software running on popular personal computers and workstations. The research presented herein was originally driven by current demands in the Internet. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, the number of users, hosts, domains, and networks connected to the Internet seems to be exploding. Not surprisingly, network traffic at major exchange points is doubling every few months. The Internet is a packet network, where each data packet is passed from a router to the next in the chain, until it reaches destination. For versatility and efficient utilization of the available transmission bandwidth, each router performs its decision where to forward a packet as independent of the other routers and the other packets for the same destination as possible. Five key factors are required to keep pace if the Internet is to continue to provide good service: (1) higher link speeds, (2) better router data throughput, (3) faster packet forwarding rates, (4) quick adaptation to topology and load changes, and (5) the support for Quality-of-Service (QoS). Solutions for the first two are readily available: fiber-optic cables using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) and switching backplane interconnects. We present longest matching prefix techniques which help solving the other three factors. They allow for a high rate of forwarding decisions, quick updates, and can be extended to classify packets based on multiple fields. The best known longest matching prefix solutions require memory accesses proportional to the length of the addresses. Our new algorithm uses binary search on hash tables organized by prefix lengths and scales very well as address and routing table sizes increase: independent of the table size, it requires a worst case time of log2(address bits) hash lookups. Thus only 5 hash lookups are needed for the current Internet protocol version 4 (IPv4) with 32 address bits and 7 for the upcoming IPv6 with 128 address bits. We also introduce mutating binary search and other optimizations that, operating on the largest available databases, reduce the worst case to 4 hashes and allow the majority of addresses to be found with at most 2 hashes. We expect similar improvements to hold for IPv6. We extend these results to find the best match for a tuple of multiple fields of the packet's header, as required for QoS support. We also show the versatility of the resulting algorithms by using it for such diverse applications as geographical information systems, memory management, garbage collection, persistent object-oriented databases, keeping distributed databases synchronized, and performing web-server access control.",excluded,2002,"Waldvogel, Marcel; Plattner, B.; Dr, Prof; Varghese, G. & Breuer, In Memoriam Ulrich",http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.21.339,,DI and QoS

,Network implications of cloud computing,"Cloud Computing is often described as ""resources accessed via a browser over the Internet."" However, this definition has become increasingly insufficient to characterize the breadth of applications and use cases for the cloud, and the networks that must support them. A broadening range of endpoints are accessing the cloud: browser-free device apps, multimedia endpoints such as video and game consoles, sensor networks, servers, and storage. The wireline and wireless network requirements-e.g., jitter, latency, packet loss, protocol support-for these uses vary, and imply that a variety of network capabilities are sometimes necessary: e.g., MPLS for quality of service via class of service to support interactive high definition video in the cloud; optical transport for native protocols such as Fibre Channel for data integration in hybrid cloud scenarios; route control for country compliance issues. Also, distributed topologies and optimized routing are required due to application latency constraints. Moreover, wireless sensor networks and hybrid cloud scenarios such as cloudbursting that require a variety of complex distributed data approaches are driving new transport requirements: guaranteed bandwidth, dynamic bandwidth on demand, and usage-sensitive pricing for fine-grained quantities and duration of bandwidth. Cloud Computing, either as an integrated service or in support of pure-play customers must drive service providers' international telecommunications infrastructure evolution as well as BSS/OSS.",?,2011,"Weinman, J.",,,DI and QoS
,Performance analysis and application of PMCAP/CDMA in voice/data integration networks,"Preamble minislot channel access protocol (PMCAP/CDMA) is a receiver-oriented medium access protocol. PMCAP/CDMA is applied to voice and data integration networks in a single cell. A dynamic code-set assignment strategy is proposed to separate voice/data access contention and guarantee the QoS of these traffics. A PCAR (proposed code-pool assignment rule) is proposed to decrease the collision probability of the same type of traffic. The simulation shows that the dynamic code-set assignment strategy is more adaptive to the fluctuation of voice/data traffic. By using PCAR in PMCAP/CDMA, the performance of data traffic is significantly improved while the performance of voice traffic remains good",excluded,2001,Wenhua Jiao; Zhimin Liu & Qinglin Liang,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=956928,IEEE,DI and QoS
,Performance analysis for voice and data integration in hybrid fiber/coax networks,This paper examines the performance for the integrated voice and data services in hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) networks through mathematical analysis. Our objective is to obtain the feasible region (FR) for the integrated services subjected to their packet level quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. The analysis is focused on the upstream channel and the performance of the system is evaluated in terms of voice packet loss probability and the mean data message delay. Two different service classes are provided for voice. The voice packet loss probability is independent of data traffic and an elaborate discrete-time Markov chain model is developed. The data traffic is modeled as a batch Poisson arrival model. Two schemes are considered for data: with or without bandwidth reservation. The integrated voice and data systems are analyzed using the matrix-analytic method. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of such a proposed integrated voice and data system.,excluded,2001,"Xiao, Xiaojun; Chew, Yong Huat; Seah, Winston K.G. & Ko, Chi Chung",http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128601001591,,DI and QoS
,Communications solutions for the Prognostics \& Health Management architecture,"New DoD requirements to implement Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) capabilities are creating new demands on communication systems for collecting PHM data from fielded systems. This is a ldquoproactive equipment maintenance capability enabled by using Health Management indications to predict a functional failure ahead of the event and take appropriate actionrdquo. PHM involves the collection and processing of precursors to failure data from fielded platforms for the purpose of mitigating failures before mission loss. Although communication systems and networks have mainly been used for mission execution, there is a growing need to communicate predictive system health data in order to mitigate field failures before they affect mission success. These new PHM data requirements include Remaining Useful Life and configuration data to be collected from all fielded products using various communication devices and networks. The following PHM communication challenges and proposed solutions are discussed in this paper: (a) Collecting PHM data from field systems using Ad-hoc networks; (b) Mitigating bandwidth usage via data transformation techniques; (c) Prioritizing and provisioning high QoS for mission-critical data; (d) Managing health information using distributed databases.",excluded,2008,"Xu, Ethan; Weber, Tom; Buibish, Anne-Marie; Lewis, James L.; Hughes, Tim & Schofield, Guy",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=4753130,IEEE,DI and QoS
,Voice and data integration on TCP/IP wireless networks,"The capacity of a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) wireless LAN with voice and data services using the TCP/IP protocol is analyzed to obtain a lower bound for the capacity of the 802.11 wireless networks with voice and data services. The voice traffic is given higher priority over the data traffic to accommodate the delay requirement for an acceptable quality of service (QoS). This is implemented by assigning the TCP protocol for the data and the UDP protocol for the voice. The relationship between the data throughput and the number of the voice users supported in this environment is analyzed.

,Fault tolerance study for durable storage on the cloud,"Durability indicates a system's ability to preserve committed data in the long term. It is one of the key requirements for storage systems. Various fault tolerance strategies have been proposed for traditional distributed databases, peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, and grid systems. These strategies were all developed for specific platforms and application types and have been tailored to the characteristics of the underlying system architectures and application requirements. Cloud systems differ from these previous frameworks in that they are designed to support large numbers of customer-oriented applications, each with different quality of service (QoS) requirements and resource consumption characteristics. Moreover, most cloud architectures are deployed over large-scale geographically distributed infrastructures, raising challenges on data durability as well as system efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we investigated different approaches to the design of durable data cloud platforms. In particular, we consider prevailing cloud platforms and cloud-based applications and examine the impacts of different redundancy and repair strategies to enhance the durability of the data in the cloud. We verify the performance of various approaches to data durability in the Cloud through extensive simulations.",included,2011,"Zhang, Xiaofei & Chen, Lei",http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6138548,IEEE,DI and QoS
