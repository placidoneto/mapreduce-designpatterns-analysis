	Pervasive use of cloud computing and resulting rise in the number of hosting datacenters (which provide platform or software services to clients who do not have the means to set up and operate their own facilities) have brought forth many challenges including energy cost, peak power dissipation, cooling, carbon emission, etc. With power consumption becoming an increasingly important issue for the operation and maintenance of the hosting datacenters, corporate and business owners are becoming increasingly concerned. Furthermore provisioning resources in a cost-optimal manner so as to meet different criteria such as response time, throughput, network bandwidth, etc. has become a critical challenge. The goal of this chapter is to provide a review of resource provisioning and power management strategies that optimize serverrelated energy costs in a datacenter while meeting the stipulated service level agreements in terms of throughput and response time.
