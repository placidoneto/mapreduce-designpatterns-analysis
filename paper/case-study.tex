\subsection{Political Big Data Analysis}
\label{:sec:election-analysis}

Big data and political event  (both, a political event or an
election) can be used considering what users react publishing their point of
view in social networks, by analysing online information seeking during the
political event.

The overall aim of this case study is to enhance current research on the use of
internet generated "big data" coming social media for
understand how people react considering a political event.
This is an area which has generated considerable interest in computer science and political science, yet
also much disappointment, following the poor predictive power identified by much
current research (for example, the number of times vips - very importante
persons/politicals - are mentioned on Twitter).
